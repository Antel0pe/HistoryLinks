'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that is against all forms of [[authority]] and seeks to abolish the [[institutions]] it claims maintain unnecessary [[coercion]] and [[Social hierarchy|hierarchy]], typically including the [[state (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]]. Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with [[Stateless society|stateless societies]] and [[Voluntary association|voluntary]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]]. As a historically [[left-wing]] movement, this reading of anarchism is placed on the [[Far-left politics|farthest left]] of the [[political spectrum]], usually described as the [[libertarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]] ([[libertarian socialism]]).

Although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. [[#Schools of thought|Various anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more, growing in popularity and influence within [[anti-capitalist]], [[anti-war]] and [[anti-globalisation]] movements.

Anarchists employ [[diversity of tactics|diverse approaches]], which may be generally divided into revolutionary and [[evolutionary strategies]]; there is significant overlap between the two. Evolutionary methods try to simulate what an anarchist society might be like, but revolutionary tactics, which have historically taken a violent turn, aim to overthrow authority and the state. Many facets of human civilization have been influenced by anarchist theory, critique, and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].

== Etymology, terminology, and definition ==
{{main|Definition of anarchism and libertarianism}}
{{see also|Glossary of anarchism}}
[[File:WilhelmWeitling.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Weitling]] is an example of a writer who added to anarchist theory without using the exact term.{{sfn|Carlson|1972|pp=22â€“23}}]]
The etymological origin of ''anarchism'' is from the Ancient Greek ''anarkhia'' (á¼€Î½Î±ÏÏ‡Î¯Î±), meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the prefix ''an-'' (&quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (&quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The suffix ''[[-ism]]'' denotes the ideological current that favours [[anarchy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} ''Anarchism'' appears in English from 1642 as ''anarchisme'' and ''anarchy'' from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder.{{sfnm|1a1=Merriam-Webster|1y=2019|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=''Oxford English Dictionary''|2y=2005|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|3a1=Sylvan|3y=2007|3p=260}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as ''anarchists'', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756â€“1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808â€“1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27â€“37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an ''anarchist'' ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809â€“1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} ''[[libertarianism]]'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|GuÃ©rin|1970|loc=&quot;The Basic Ideas of Anarchism&quot;}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=FernÃ¡ndez|4y=2009|4p=9}} Some usages of ''libertarianism'' refer to [[individualistic]] [[free-market]] philosophy only, and [[free-market anarchism]] in particular is termed ''libertarian anarchism''.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}

While the term ''libertarian'' has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Cohn|2y=2009|2p=6}} its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups,{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} including both the [[New Left]] and [[libertarian Marxists]], who do not associate themselves with [[authoritarian socialists]] or a [[vanguard party]], and extreme [[cultural liberals]], who are primarily concerned with [[civil liberties]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} Additionally, some anarchists use ''[[libertarian socialist]]''{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Cohn|2y=2009|2p=6|3a1=Levy|3a2=Adams|3y=2018|3p=104}} to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with [[socialism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} ''Anarchism'' is broadly used to describe the [[anti-authoritarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]].{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=104}}{{refn|In ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (1970),{{sfn|GuÃ©rin|1970|p=12}} anarchist historian [[Daniel GuÃ©rin]] described it as a synonym for [[libertarian socialism]], and wrote that anarchism &quot;is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State.&quot;{{sfn|Arvidsson|2017}} In his many works on anarchism, historian [[Noam Chomsky]] describes anarchism, alongside [[libertarian Marxism]], as the [[libertarian]] wing of [[socialism]].{{sfn|Otero|1994|p=617}}|group=nb}} Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state-oriented or from above.{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} Scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism's socialist credentials{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two.{{sfn|Morris|2015|p=64}} Some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from [[liberalism]],{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} and being both liberal and socialist but more so.{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} Many scholars reject [[anarcho-capitalism]] as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564â€“565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morris|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393â€“394}}{{refn|[[Herbert L. Osgood]] claimed that anarchism is &quot;the extreme antithesis&quot; of [[authoritarian communism]] and [[state socialism]].{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]] states that &quot;[i]n general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. ... Anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp, but it also has outriders in liberalism. It cannot be reduced to socialism, and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine.&quot;{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} According to [[Jeremy Jennings]], &quot;[i]t is hard not to conclude that these ideas&quot;, referring to [[anarcho-capitalism]], &quot;are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is.&quot; Jennings adds that &quot;anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual (as the 'anarcho-capitalists' appear to believe) but, as we have already seen, for the extension of individuality and community.&quot;{{sfn|Jennings|1999|p=147}} [[Nicolas Walter]] wrote that &quot;anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically. ... In a sense, anarchists always remain liberals and socialists, and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself. ... We are liberals but more so, and socialists but more so.&quot;{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} Michael Newman includes anarchism as one of many [[socialist traditions]], especially the more socialist-aligned tradition following Proudhon and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morris]] argues that it is &quot;conceptually and historically misleading&quot; to &quot;create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism.&quot;{{sfn|Morris|2015|p=64}}|group=nb}}

While [[Anti-statism|opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining ''anarchism'' is not an easy task for scholars, as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter, and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}}{{refn|One common definition adopted by anarchists is that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organisation]], including [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and all associated [[institution]]s, in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[decentralisation]], [[freedom]], and [[voluntary association]]. Scholars highlight that this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on anti-authoritarianism (''[[a posteriori]]'' conclusion), anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that),{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1p=166|2a1=Jun|2y=2009|2p=507|3a1=Franks|3y=2013|3pp=386â€“388}} and etymology (negation of rulers).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25â€“29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}}|group=nb}} Major definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society, and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25â€“26}}

== History ==
{{main|History of anarchism}}

=== Pre-modern era ===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] ({{Circa|334|262 BC}}), whose ''[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]
The most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] (the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophers [[Zhuang Zhou]] and [[Laozi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Alongside [[Stoicism]], Taoism has been said to have had &quot;significant anticipations&quot; of anarchism.{{Sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=257}}

Anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between laws imposed by the state and personal [[autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned [[Athens|Athenian]] authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''[[physis]]''). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66â€“73}}

In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements. These, and other Muslim movements, later gave birth to [[Anarchism and religion|religious anarchism]]. In the [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Mazdak]] called for an [[egalitarian]] society and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by Emperor [[Kavad I]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}}

In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state.{{Sfn|Crone|2000|pp=3, 21â€“25}} In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies.{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=8}} Renewed interest in antiquity during the [[Renaissance]] and in private judgment during the [[Reformation]] restored elements of anti-authoritarian secularism, particularly in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=108}} [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] challenges to intellectual authority (secular and religious) and the [[List of revolutions and rebellions|revolutions of the 1790s and 1848]] all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=307}}

=== Modern era ===
During the [[French Revolution]], partisan groups such as the [[EnragÃ©s]] and the {{lang|fr|[[sans-culottes]]}} saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as [[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in England, morally delegitimising the state, [[Max Stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4â€“5}} By the late 1870s, various anarchist schools of thought had become well-defined and a wave of then unprecedented [[globalisation]] occurred from 1880 to 1914.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=10â€“15}} This era of [[classical anarchism]] lasted until the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is considered the golden age of anarchism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4â€“5}}

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Mikhail Bakunin opposed the Marxist aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.]]
Drawing from mutualism, [[Mikhail Bakunin]] founded [[collectivist anarchism]] and entered the [[International Workingmen's Association]], a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, with [[Karl Marx]] being a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction (the [[Jura Federation]]) and Proudhon's followers (the mutualists) opposed [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} After bitter disputes, the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the [[Marxists]] at the [[1872 Hague Congress]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334â€“336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} Anarchists were treated similarly in the [[Second International]], being ultimately expelled in 1896.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=12}} Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. In response to their expulsion from the First International, anarchists formed the [[St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one's needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}}

By the turn of the 20th century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} It was a notable feature of the international syndicalist movement.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=16}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519â€“521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for [[rebellion|rebellious]] youth from [[East Asia]]n countries, who moved to the Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681â€“682}} In [[Latin America]], [[Anarchism in Argentina|Argentina]] was a stronghold for [[anarcho-syndicalism]], where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504â€“508}} During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary [[political violence]], known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633â€“636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to prevent anarchists immigrating to the US, including the [[Immigration Act of 1903]], also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=633â€“636|2a1=Lutz|2a2=Ulmschneider|2y=2019|2p=46}} [[Illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|right|Nestor Makhno seen with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine]]]]
Despite concerns, anarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]] in opposition to the [[White movement]], especially in the [[Makhnovshchina]]; however, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] had stabilised, including during the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine, before the Bolsheviks crushed the anarchist movement there too.{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} With the anarchists being repressed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]], many workers and activists turned to [[communist parties]] which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements such as the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] left their organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}}

In the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936â€“39, anarchists and syndicalists ([[ConfederaciÃ³n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[FederaciÃ³n Anarquista IbÃ©rica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of [[Spanish anarchism]] led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war, and particularly in the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936]]. In response to the army [[rebellion]], an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain, where they [[collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The [[Soviet Union]] provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight between communists and other leftists in a series of events known as the [[May Days]], as Joseph Stalin asserted Soviet control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] government, ending in another defeat of anarchists at the hands of the communists.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}

==== Post-WWII ====
[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|Rojava's support efforts for workers to form cooperatives is exemplified in this sewing cooperative.]]
By the end of [[World War II]], the anarchist movement had been severely weakened.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} The 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism, likely caused by a perceived failure of [[Marxismâ€“Leninism]] and tensions built by the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this time, anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]], and [[peace movement]]s, the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[New Left]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 539}} It also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative [[anti-capitalist reform]]ism.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=5|p=}} Anarchism became associated with [[punk subculture]] as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493â€“494}} The established [[feminist]] tendencies of [[anarcha-feminism]] returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556â€“557}} [[Black anarchism]] began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism's move from a [[Eurocentric]] demographic.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=680}} This coincided with its failure to gain traction in Northern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|p=70}}

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti-capitalist, anti-war and [[anti-globalisation]] movements.{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Group of Eight]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]. During the protests, ''ad hoc'' leaderless anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s engaged in [[riot]]ing, [[property destruction]] and violent confrontations with the [[police]]. Other organisational tactics pioneered at this time include [[affinity group]]s, [[security culture]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 Seattle WTO conference]].{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as [[Rojava]], a ''de facto'' [[Permanent autonomous zone|autonomous region]] in northern Syria.{{sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}}

While having revolutionary aspirations, many forms of anarchism are not confrontational nowadays. Instead, they are trying to build an alternative way of social organization, based on mutual interdependence and voluntary cooperation. Scholar Carissa Honeywell takes the example of [[Food not Bombs]] group of collectives, to highlight some features of how anarchist groups work: direct action, working together and in solidarity with those left behind. While doing so, they inform about the rising rates of world hunger suggest a policy to tackle hunger, ranging from de-funding the arms industry to addressing Monsanto seed-saving policies and patents, helping farmers and commodification of food and housing.{{sfn|Honeywell|2021|pp=34â€“44}} Honeywell also emphasizes that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not only of humans, but non-humans and the environment as well.{{sfn|Honeywell|2021|pp=1â€“2}} Honeywell argues that escalation of problems such as continuous wars and world poverty show that the current framework not only cannot solve those pressing problems for humanity, but are causal factors as well, resulting in the rejection of representative democracy and the state as a whole.{{sfn|Honeywell|2021|pp=1â€“3}}

== Schools of thought ==
Anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, [[social anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], owing to their different origins, values and evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=Ostergaard|2y=2003|2p=14|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} The individualist current emphasises [[negative liberty]] in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises [[positive liberty]] in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and [[social ownership]].{{sfn|Harrison|Boyd|2003|p=251}} In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post-classical currents ([[anarcha-feminism]], [[green anarchism]], and [[post-anarchism]]) developed thereafter.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=9}}

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=2}} A component especially of individualist anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Ostergaard|1y=2003|1p=12|2a1=Gabardi|2y=1986|2pp=300â€“302}} philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a [[minimal state]] but claims that citizens have no [[moral obligation]] to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy.{{sfn|Klosko|2005|p=4}} Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since [[ethics]] have a central role in anarchist philosophy.{{sfn|Franks|2019|p=549}} Anarchism's emphasis on [[anti-capitalism]], [[egalitarianism]], and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho-capitalism and other types of [[economic libertarian]]ism.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564â€“565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morris|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393â€“394}}

Anarchism is usually placed on the far-left of the political spectrum.{{sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=Kahn|2y=2000|3a1=Moynihan|3y=2007}} Much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[anti-authoritarian]], [[anti-statist]], [[libertarian]], and [[Radical politics|radical]] interpretations of [[left-wing]] and [[socialist]] politics{{sfn|GuÃ©rin|1970|p=12}} such as [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[anarchist communism|communism]], [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], among other [[libertarian socialist]] economic theories.{{sfn|GuÃ©rin|1970|p=35|loc=&quot;Critique of authoritarian socialism&quot;}} As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14â€“17}} many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}} One reaction against [[sectarianism]] within the anarchist milieu was [[anarchism without adjectives]], a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del MÃ¡rmol]] in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.{{sfn|Avrich|1996|p=6}} Belief in political [[nihilism]] has been espoused by anarchists.{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=52}} Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of shared principles such as autonomy, mutual aid, anti-authoritarianism and decentralisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=1â€“6|2a1=Angelbeck|2a2=Grier|2y=2012|2p=551}}

=== Classical ===
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is the primary proponent of mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=216â€“218}}]]
Inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]]. They were followed by the major currents of social anarchism ([[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]], [[anarchist communism|communist]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]]). They differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=2}}

Mutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Its aims include &quot;abolishing the state&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Desk Encyclopedia of World History |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7394-7809-7 |editor-last=Wright |editor-first=Edmund |location=New York |pages=20â€“21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|free association]], voluntary contract, [[federation]] and [[monetary reform]] of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=213â€“218}} Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1996|1p=6|2a1=Miller|2y=1991|2p=11}} In ''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840), Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;{{sfn|Pierson|2013|p=187}} Collectivist anarchism is a [[revolutionary socialist]] form of anarchism{{sfn|Morris|1993|p=76}} commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Shannon|2019|p=101}} Collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution{{sfn|Avrich|1996|pp=3â€“4}} and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside Marxism but rejected the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist [[stateless society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heywood|1y=2017|1pp=146â€“147|2a1=Bakunin|2y=1990}}

Anarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a [[communist society]] with [[common ownership]] of the means of production,{{sfn|Mayne|1999|p=131}} held by a [[federalism|federal]] network of [[voluntary association]]s,{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=327}} with production and consumption based on the guiding principle &quot;[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=327|2a1=Turcato|2y=2019|2pp=237â€“238}} Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the [[French Revolution]]{{sfn|Graham|2005}} but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].{{sfn|Pernicone|2009|pp=111â€“113}} It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of [[Peter Kropotkin]],{{sfn|Turcato|2019|pp=239â€“244}} whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=6}} Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views [[labour syndicate]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are [[direct action]], workers' [[solidarity]] and [[workers' self-management]].{{sfn|Van der Walt|2019|p=249}}

Individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants.{{sfn|Ryley|2019|p=225}} Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include [[William Godwin]], [[Max Stirner]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=440}} as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as [[illegalism]] and [[individual reclamation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Imrie|1y=1994|2a1=Parry|2y=1987|2p=15}}

=== Post-classical and contemporary ===
{{main|Contemporary anarchism}}
[[File:Jarach and Zerzan.JPG|thumb|Lawrence Jarach (left) and [[John Zerzan]] (right) are two prominent contemporary anarchist authors, with Zerzan being a prominent voice within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and Jarach a notable advocate of [[post-left anarchy]].]]
Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti-globalisation movement,{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and [[syncretic|combining disparate concepts]] to create new philosophical approaches.{{sfn|Williams|2007|p=303}} The anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.{{sfn|Williams|2018|p=4}}

Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes [[black bloc]] demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence. Its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement, although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory.{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Evren|2y=2011|2p=1|3a1=Angelbeck|3a2=Grier|3y=2012|3p=549}} Various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385â€“386}} While theorists and activists have established &quot;relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles&quot;, there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple ''anarchisms'', rather than a singular ''anarchism'', in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. Gender equality can be a common principle, although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha-feminists than anarcho-communists.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}}

Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely &quot;all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, [[white supremacy]], and imperialism.&quot;{{sfn|Jun|2009|pp=507â€“508}} Anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.{{sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}} The principle of [[equal liberty]] is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions. This entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state, resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=91}}

== Tactics ==
Anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals, namely, to first oppose [[the Establishment]] and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=107â€“108}} A broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4â€“5}} Evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence, reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, although there is significant overlap between the two.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|p=125}}

Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=112}}

=== Classical era ===
[[File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg|thumb|right|The relationship between [[anarchism and violence]] is a controversial subject among anarchists as shown by anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]] [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinating]] [[William McKinley]].]]
During the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces, as in Spain and Ukraine, but some of them also employed terrorism as [[propaganda of the deed]]. Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in [[revolution]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=112â€“113}} Many anarchists, especially the [[Galleanists]], believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state.{{sfn|Norris|2020|pp=7â€“8}} Many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s, the early 1880s and the 1890s, with some still occurring in the early 1900s.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=13|2a1=Nesser|2y=2012|2p=62}} Their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|p=55}}

Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial.{{sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} Anarcho-pacifists advocate for non-violence means to achieve their stateless, nonviolent ends.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=section 3.1}} Other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of [[sabotage]] or terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a [[tyrant]] and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=116â€“117}} [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]].{{sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320â€“325}}

Anarchists took an active role in [[strike action]]s, although they tended to be antipathetic to formal [[syndicalism]], seeing it as [[reformist]]. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=113}} Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced [[naturism]] and [[nudism]]. Those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=114}}

=== Revolutionary ===
[[File:Black bloc at RNC running.jpg|thumb|Black bloc protesters parading anarcho-communism imagery such as the motto &quot;[[No War but the Class War]]&quot;]]
In the current era, Italian anarchist [[Alfredo Bonanno]], a proponent of [[insurrectionary anarchism]], has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group [[The Invisible Committee]] advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism, and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=134â€“135}}

Overall, contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries such as Canada, [[Anarchism in Greece|Greece]], and [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]]. Militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police;{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=115}} however, anarchists not only clash with state operators, they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking [[anti-fascist]] action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=117}}

=== Evolutionary ===
Anarchists commonly employ [[direct action]]. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4â€“5}} Decision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[horizontalidad|horizontalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109â€“117}} Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various [[grassroots]] movements that are more or less based on horizontalism, although not explicitly anarchist, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. In contrast with the ''big-A anarchism'' of the classical era, the newly coined term ''small-a anarchism'' signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to justify their opinions. Those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=145â€“149}}

The decision-making process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics, goals and values. Anarchists usually form small groups (5â€“20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]] as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=119â€“121}}

As in the past, newspapers and journals are used, and anarchists have gone online in the [[World Wide Web]] to spread their message. Anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties, hosting electronic libraries and other portals.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=118â€“119}} Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users' privacy from state surveillance.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=120â€“121}}

Anarchists organize themselves to [[Squatting|squat]] and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s (TAZ), spaces where art, poetry, and [[surrealism]] are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=Mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=Williams|3y=2018|3pp=5â€“6}} As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=Williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=122}} Adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[carnivalesque]] atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.{{sfn|Morland|2004|pp=37â€“38}}

== Key issues ==
{{main|Issues in anarchism}}
&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
As anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought, disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common. Its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed, and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism, [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], Marxism, and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], technology (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism), and the [[Anarchism and statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|De George|2005|pp=31â€“32}}

=== The state ===
&lt;!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. --&gt;[[File:Fight_the_state,_not_wars.jpg|thumb|Anarchist protesters in [[Boston]] opposing state-waged war]]
Objection to the [[State (polity)|state]] and its institutions is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=1971|1p=14|2a1=Jun|2y=2019|2pp=29â€“30}} Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]], as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32â€“38}}

Specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. [[Robert Paul Wolff]] believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate. Bakunin saw the state as meaning &quot;coercion, domination by means of coercion, camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be.&quot; [[A. John Simmons]] and [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]], who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely.{{sfnm|1a1=Wendt|1y=2020|1p=2|2a1=Ashwood|2y=2018|2p=727}} Beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ.{{Sfn|Ashwood|2018|p=735}}

=== Gender, sexuality, and free love ===
{{Main|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex}}
As gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy, many anarchists address, analyse, and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy imposed by gender roles.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}}

[[File:AnarchaFeminism.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Collection of [[anarcha-feminist]] protests, symbols, and flags]]
Sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} Sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], who opposed age of consent laws, believing they would benefit predatory men.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=178}} A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]. In contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]], [[relationship anarchy]], and [[queer anarchism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175â€“176}} Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women's sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175â€“176}} Those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists and other activists slept in beds together.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States; however, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175â€“177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, and pro-choice (utilising a contemporary term), and had a similar agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=166â€“167}}

During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[second wave of feminism]], radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalised groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609â€“611}} With the [[third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, yielding a [[post-structuralist]] critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610â€“611}} Some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616â€“617}}

The interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider proper education, one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83â€“85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514â€“515, 520}} Anarchist writers such as William Godwin (''[[Political Justice]]'') and Max Stirner (&quot;[[The False Principle of Our Education]]&quot;) attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83â€“86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222}}

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Escuela Moderna]] in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511â€“512}} Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. Nonetheless, his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511â€“514}} [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] Leo Tolstoy, who published the essay ''Education and Culture'', also established a similar school with its founding principle being that &quot;for education to be effective it had to be free.&quot;{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517â€“518}} In a similar token, A. S. Neill founded what became the Summerhill School in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518â€“519}}

Anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child's right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions; however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation. Ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism, along with other critiques of government and nationalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1980|1pp=3â€“33|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=519â€“522}}

Late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ([[Paul Goodman]], [[Herbert Read]], and [[Colin Ward]]) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in [[consumerism]] as part of a consumer society.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=89â€“96}} Contemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality.{{sfn|Ward|1973|pp=39â€“48}}

While few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day, major tenets of anarchist schools, among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. Judith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists' schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools, the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England, and the Paideia School in Spain.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523â€“526}}

=== The arts ===
{{main|Anarchism and the arts}}
[[File:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|340px|''Les chataigniers a Osny'' (1888) by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro is a notable example of blending anarchism and the arts.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}]]
The connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=592}} In literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] and the [[neo-romanticism]] movement.{{sfn|Gifford|2019|p=577}} In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=493â€“494|2a1=Dunn|2y=2012|3a1=Evren|3a2=Kinna|3a3=Rouselle|3y=2013|p=138}} Anarchists such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Herbert Read]] stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=592â€“593}}

Other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=593}} In his book ''Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas'', Chris RobÃ© claims that &quot;anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism.&quot;{{sfn|RobÃ©|2017|p=44}} Throughout the 20th century, many prominent anarchists (Peter Kropotkin, [[Emma Goldman]], [[Gustav Landauer]] and [[Camillo Berneri]]) and publications such as ''[[Anarchy (magazine)|Anarchy]]'' wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.{{sfn|Miller|Dirlik|Rosemont|Augustyn|2019|p=1}}

Three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists. It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies, serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=593â€“596}} The 19th-century [[neo-impressionist]] movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=78}} In ''Les chataigniers a Osny'' by anarchist painter [[Camille Pissarro]], the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}

== Criticism ==
The most common critique of anarchism is the assertion that humans cannot [[Self-governance|self-govern]] and so a state is necessary for human survival. Philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] supported this critique, stating that &quot;[p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government.&quot;{{sfn|Krimerman|Perry|1966|p=494}} Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism.{{sfn|Ward|2004|p=78}}

Another criticism of anarchism is the belief that it is inherently unstable: that an anarchist society would inevitably evolve back into a state. [[Thomas Hobbes]] and other early social contract theorists argued that the state emerges in response to natural anarchy in order to protect the people's interests and keep order. Philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] argued that a &quot;[[night-watchman state]]&quot;, or minarchy, would emerge from anarchy through the process of an [[invisible hand]], in which people would exercise their liberty and buy protection from protection agencies, evolving into a minimal state. Anarchists reject these criticisms by arguing that humans in a [[state of nature]] would not just be in a state of war. [[Anarcho-primitivism|Anarcho-primitivists]] in particular argue that humans were better off in a state of nature in small tribes living close to the land, while anarchists in general argue that the negatives of state organization, such as hierarchies, monopolies and inequality, outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Fiala |first=Andrew |title=Anarchism |date=2021 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/anarchism/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |access-date=2023-06-17 |edition=Winter 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world, such as at protests, but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically. This line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory as a ruling theory that has no ruling theory. Anarchism also calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual, hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=&quot;4. Objections and Replies&quot;}}

Philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro-anarchist books such as A. John Simmons' ''Moral Principles and Political Obligations''.{{sfn|Klosko|1999|p=536}} Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious. Edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate.{{sfnm|1a1=Klosko|1y=1999|1p=536|2a1=KristjÃ¡nsson|2y=2000|2p=896}} In ''The Problem of Political Authority'', [[Michael Huemer]] defends philosophical anarchism,{{sfn|Dagger|2018|p=35}} claiming that &quot;political authority is a moral illusion.&quot;{{sfn|Rogers|2020|p=}}

One of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority.{{sfn|Ferguson|1886}} [[Joseph Raz]] states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=37}} Raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities' successful and mistaken instruction.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=38}} Anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable, nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment.{{sfn|Gans|1992|pp=34, 38}} Anarchist perception of human nature, rejection of the state, and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive, overly simplistic, and unrealistic, respectively.{{sfn|Brinn|2020|p=206}} Classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}}

[[Friedrich Engels]], considered to be one of the principal founders of Marxism, criticised anarchism's anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian.{{sfn|Tucker|1978}} Academic [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]] writes in his book ''Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism'' that &quot;anarchism cannot win&quot;, believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{sfn|Dodds|2011}} The Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to the Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining.{{sfn|BaÃ¡r|Falina|Janowski|KopeÄek|2016|p=488}}

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|Ã¦|l|Ëˆ|b|iË|d|oÊŠ}} {{respell|al|BEE|doh}}; {{etymology|la|albedo|whiteness}}) is the fraction of [[sunlight]] that is [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] by a body. It is measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation). ''Surface albedo'' is defined as the ratio of [[Radiosity (radiometry)|radiosity]] ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; to the [[irradiance]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (flux per unit area) received by a surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Fundamentals of Rendering - Radiometry / Photometry|author1=Pharr|author2=Humphreys|website=Web.cse.ohio-state.edu|access-date=2 March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Reflectance and albedo, surface |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Atmosphere |editor=J.

While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henderson-Sellers |first1=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M.

This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4â€“0.7 Î¼m), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

[[Iceâ€“albedo feedback]] is a [[positive feedback]] climate process where a change in the area of [[ice caps]], [[glaciers]], and [[sea ice]] alters the albedo and surface temperature of a planet. [[Ice]] is very reflective, therefore it reflects far more solar energy back to space than the other types of land area or open water. Iceâ€“albedo feedback plays an important role in global [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Budyko |first=M.

Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo â€“ from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot; /&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites, and the CERES instrument on the [[Suomi NPP]] and [[Joint Polar Satellite System|JPSS]]. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot; /&gt;). These calculations are based on the [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about {{convert|15|C|F}}. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below {{convert|âˆ’40|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about {{convert|0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot; /&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water â€“ a so-called [[ocean planet]] â€“ the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost {{convert|27|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot; /&gt;

&lt;!--===Variability and recent/spatiotemporal changes===--&gt;
In 2021, scientists reported that Earth dimmed by ~0.5% over two decades (1998â€“2017) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques. This may have both been co-caused by [[climate change]] as well as a substantial increase in global warming. However, the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gray |first1=Jennifer |title=The Earth isn't as bright as it once was |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/04/weather/earth-dimming-climate/index.html |access-date=19 October 2021 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goode |first1=P.

===White-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo===
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''Î¸''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:
* the [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and
* the [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]], &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo.
with &lt;math&gt;{1-D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = (1 - D) \bar\alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{\bar\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot; /&gt;

It has been found that [[urbanization]] generally decreases albedo (commonly being 0.01â€“0.02 lower than adjacent [[croplands]]), which contributes to [[global warming]]. Deliberately increasing albedo in urban areas can mitigate [[urban heat island]]. Ouyang et al. estimated that, on a global scale, &quot;an albedo increase of 0.1 in worldwide urban areas would result in a cooling effect that is equivalent to absorbing ~44 [[Gigatons|Gt]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ouyang |first1=Zutao |last2=Sciusco |first2=Pietro |last3=Jiao |first3=Tong |last4=Feron |first4=Sarah |last5=Li |first5=Cheyenne |last6=Li |first6=Fei |last7=John |first7=Ranjeet |last8=Peilei |first8=Fan |last9=Li |first9=Xia |last10=Williams |first10=Christopher A. |last11=Chen |first11=Guangzhao |last12=Wang |first12=Chenghao |last13=Chen |first13=Jiquan |date=July 2022 |title=Albedo changes caused by future urbanization contribute to global warming |journal=Nature Communications |volume=13 |issue=1 |page=3800 |bibcode=2022NatCo..13.3800O |doi=10.1038/s41467-022-31558-z |pmc=9249918 |pmid=35778380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==
[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The percentage of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] [[sunlight]] relative to various surface conditions]]

=== Illumination ===
Albedo is not directly dependent on the illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g. through melting of reflective ice). However, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winston&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818â€“827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolation effects===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] ([[solar irradiance]]); high albedo areas in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albedo Effect |url=https://www.npolar.no/en/fact/albedo/ |website=Norsk PolarInstitutt |publisher=Norwegian Polar Institute |access-date=23 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [[Iceâ€“albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=8 May 2017|date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albedoâ€“temperature feedback===
{{Further|Iceâ€“albedo feedback}}
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snowâ€“temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snowâ€“temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass, soil, or ocean, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Dorothy K. |author-link=Dorothy Hall (scientist)|title=Remote Sensing of Ice and Snow |date=1985 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-94-009-4842-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[Antarctica]] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the iceâ€“albedo [[positive feedback]]).

In Switzerland, the citizens have been protecting their glaciers with large white tarpaulins to slow down the ice melt. These large white sheets are helping to reject the rays from the sun and defecting the heat. Although that this method is very expensive it has shown to work by reducing snow and ice melt by 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=swissinfo.ch/gw |date=2021-04-02 |title=Glacier tarpaulins an effective but expensive shield against heat |url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sci-&amp;-tech/glacier-tarpaulins-an-effective-but-expensive-shield-against-heat/46501004 |access-date=2024-02-20 |website=SWI swissinfo.ch |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more [[solar radiation]] than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;All About Sea Ice.&quot; National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for [[global warming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland â€“ Melt Zone&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175416/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 |url2=https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110806084123/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 |date=3 March 2016 |date2= 6 August 2011}} page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through [[remote sensing]] techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool!

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic devices]]. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10% for vertically (90Â°) mounted systems, but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | date = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | pages = 233â€“241 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 |bibcode = 2013SoEn...91..233A | url = https://www.academia.edu/3081684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectral albedo strongly affects the performance of [[bifacial solar cells]] where rear surface performance gains of over 20% have been observed for c-Si cells installed above healthy vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riedel-LyngskÃ¦r | first1 = Nicholas| last2 = Ribaconka | first2 = Ribaconka | last3 = Po | first3 = Mario | last4 = Thorseth | first4 = Anders | last5 = Thorsteinsson | first5 = Sune | last6 = Dam-Hansen | first6 = Carsten | last7 = Jakobsen | first7 = Michael L. | date = 2022| title = The effect of spectral albedo in bifacial photovoltaic performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 231| pages = 921â€“935 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2021.12.023 | bibcode = 2022SoEn..231..921R| s2cid = 245488941| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) provided effective albedo values for simulating the performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | author-link4 = J.

{{See also|Climate change#Land surface changes}}
Forests generally have a low albedo because the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]. For this reason, the greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of [[afforestation]] (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). In other words: The [[climate change mitigation]] effect of [[carbon sequestration]] by forests is partially counterbalanced in that [[reforestation]] can decrease the reflection of sunlight (albedo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Kaiguang |last2=Jackson |first2=Robert B |title=Biophysical forcings of land-use changes from potential forestry activities in North America |journal=Ecological Monographs |date=2014 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=329â€“353 |doi=10.1890/12-1705.1 |bibcode=2014EcoM...84..329Z |s2cid=56059160 |url=https://jacksonlab.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj20871/files/media/file/em2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover, albedo reduction may be significant enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt; Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts as strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | date = 2004 | title = Direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | journal = Climate Dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6â€“7| pages = 597â€“603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2004ClDy...22..597B | s2cid = 129640195 | url = https://www.academia.edu/25329256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonan | first1 = GB | date = 2008 | title = Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444â€“1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546|bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1444B  | s2cid = 45466312 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-to-high-latitude forests have a much lower albedo during snow seasons than flat ground, thus contributing to warming.

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt; Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ollinger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Water===
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reflectivity of smooth water at {{convert|20|C|F}} (refractive index=1.333)]]
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]].

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-01-31 |title=Arctic Reflection: Clouds Replace Snow and Ice as Solar Reflector |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/ArcticReflector/arctic_reflector4.php |access-date=2022-04-28 |website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=Nature |access-date=7 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2006|page=601|volume=418|issue=6898|date=8 August 2002|url-status=dead|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002Natur.418..601T|pmid=12167846|last1=Travis|first1=D.

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |access-date=19 August 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archive-date= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Spracklen et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In extremely polluted cities like [[Delhi]], aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an [[Urban heat island#Urban cold island|urban cool island]] effect during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Masson|first1=ValÃ©ry|last2=Lemonsu|first2=Aude|last3=Hidalgo|first3=Julia|last4=Voogt|first4=James|date=2020-10-17|title=Urban Climates and Climate Change|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|language=en|volume=45|issue=1|pages=411â€“444|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-012320-083623|doi-access=free|issn=1543-5938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean [[radiative forcing]] for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;âˆ’2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;âˆ’2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |access-date=19 August 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archive-date= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l.

== Astronomical albedo ==
[[File:Titan and Saturn - May 6 2012 - combined (35516187116).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is darker than [[Saturn]] even though they receive the same amount of sunlight. This is due to a difference in albedo (0.22 versus 0.499 in [[geometric albedo]]).]]In astronomy, the term '''albedo''' can be defined in several different ways, depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved.

===Optical or visual albedo===
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicardy&quot;&gt;

Two common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces. One of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the [[single-scattering albedo]]. It is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]), the size of the particle, and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

An important relationship between an object's astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is given by:&lt;ref name=&quot;bruton&quot;&gt;{{cite web

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometers, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute magnitude.

===Radar albedo===
In planetary [[radar astronomy]], a microwave (or radar) pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target (e.g. Moon, asteroid, etc.) and the echo from the target is measured. In most instances, the transmitted pulse is [[circular polarization|circularly polarized]] and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse (SC) and the opposite sense (OC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Planetary_Radar&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ostro |first1=S.

Those components of the received echo that return from first-surface reflections (as from a smooth or mirror-like surface) are dominated by the OC component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection. If the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith, there will be a significant SC component in the echo caused by multiple scattering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Asteroid_Radar&quot; /&gt;

For most objects in the solar system, the OC echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the (normalized) OC radar albedo (often shortened to radar albedo):&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Planetary_Radar&quot; /&gt;
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt; \hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} = \frac{{\sigma}_\text{OC}}{\pi r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where the denominator is the effective cross-sectional area of the target object with mean radius, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. A smooth metallic sphere would have &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The values reported for the Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Comet P/2005 JQ5 are derived from the total (OC+SC) radar albedo reported in those references.

====Relationship to surface [[bulk density]]====
In the event that most of the echo is from first surface reflections (&lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} &lt; 0.1&lt;/math&gt; or so), the OC radar albedo is a first-order approximation of the Fresnel reflection coefficient (aka reflectivity)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Asteroid_Radar&quot; /&gt; and can be used to estimate the bulk density of a planetary surface to a depth of a meter or so (a few wavelengths of the radar wavelength which is typically at the decimeter scale) using the following empirical relationships:&lt;ref name=&quot;Shepard_M2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shepard |first1=M. K. |display-authors=etal |title=A radar survey of M- and X-class asteroids II.

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \begin{cases}
   3.20 \text{ g cm}^{-3} \ln \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{0.83 \hat{\sigma}_\text{OC}}}{1 - \sqrt{0.83 \hat{\sigma}_\text{OC}}} \right) &amp; \text{for } \hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} \le 0.07 \\
  (6.944 \hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} + 1.083) \text{ g cm}^{-3} &amp; \text{for } \hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} &gt; 0.07
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.

== History ==
The term albedo was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[Photometria]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

'''A''', or '''a''', is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and the first [[vowel letter]] of the [[Latin alphabet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Latin-alphabet |title=Latin alphabet |encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Simpson|Weiner|1989|p=1}} used in the modern [[English alphabet]], and others worldwide. Its name in English is ''[[English alphabet#Letter names|a]]'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|eÉª}} {{respell|AY}}), plural ''aes''.{{refn|group=nb|''Aes'' is the plural of the name of the letter. The plural of the letter itself is rendered ''A''s, A's, ''a''s, or a's.}}{{sfn|Simpson|Weiner|1989|p=1}}

It is similar in shape to the Ancient Greek letter [[alpha]], from which it derives.{{sfn|McCarter|1974|p=54}} The [[uppercase]] version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version is often written in one of two forms: the double-storey {{gph|a}} and single-storey {{gph|É‘}}. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in [[italic type]].

In English, ''[[English articles|a]]'' is the [[indefinite article]], with the
alternative form ''an''.

== Name ==
In English, the name of the letter is the ''long A'' sound, pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|eÉª}}. Its name in most other languages matches the letter's pronunciation in [[open syllable]]s.
{{wide image|Pronunciation of the name of the letter âŸ¨aâŸ© in European languages.png|460px|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in European languages. {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aË/}} can differ phonetically between {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|Ã¤}}, {{IPAblink|Ã¦}} and {{IPAblink|É‘}} depending on the language.}}

== History ==
The earliest known ancestor of A is ''[[aleph]]''â€”the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]]{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}â€”where it represented a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[Ê”]}}, as Phoenician only used  [[consonant]]al letters. In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]{{sfn|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}} influenced by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

When the [[ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter representing a [[glottal stop]]â€”so they adapted sign to represent the vowel {{IPAslink|a}}, calling the letter by the similar name ''[[alpha]]''. In the earliest Greek inscriptions dating to the 8th century&amp;nbsp;BC following the [[Greek Dark Ages]], the letter rests upon its side. However, in the later [[Greek alphabet]] it generally resembles the modern capital formâ€”though many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to the [[Italian Peninsula]], and left the form of alpha unchanged. When the Romans adopted the [[Etruscan alphabet]] to write [[Latin]], the resulting form used in the [[Latin script]] would come to be used to write many  other languages, including English.

During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter A. First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other more permanent media. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the perishable nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[majuscule]] cursive, [[minuscule]] cursive, and semi-cursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.{{sfn|Diringer|2000|p=1}}

At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semi-cursive minuscule of Italy, the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the ninth century, the [[Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.{{sfn|Diringer|2000|p=1}}

[[File:Road sign on the R639 north of Urlingford, Ireland - 20090502.jpg|thumb|right|Road sign in Ireland showing the Irish &quot;Latin alpha&quot; form of {{angbr|a}} in lower and upper case forms]]
15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form {{angbr|É‘}}, also called ''script a'', is often used in [[handwriting]]; it consists of a circle with a vertical stroke on its right. In the hands of medieval Irish and English writers, this form gradually developed from a 5th-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] {{angbr|Ï„}}.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}} The Roman form {{angbr|a}} is found in most printed material, and consists of a small loop with an arc over it.{{sfn|Diringer|2000|p=1}} Both derive from the majuscule form {{angbr|A}}. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. Graphic designers refer to the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms as ''single-decker a'' and ''double decker a'' respectively.

[[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in Roman type. There are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' {{angbr|É‘}}, also called ''[[Latin alpha]]'', is used in contrast with Latin {{angbr|a}}, such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

[[File:A for apple.jpg|thumb|In English language education, the word ''[[apple]]'' is consistently associated with the letter A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mankin |first=Jennifer |last2=Simner |first2=Julia |date=May 30, 2017 |title=A Is for Apple: the Role of Letter-Word Associations in the Development of Grapheme-Colour Synaesthesia |url=https://sussex.figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/A_is_for_apple_the_role_of_letter-word_associations_in_the_development_of_grapheme-colour_synaesthesia/23444111/1/files/41154893.pdf |journal=Multisensory Research |volume=30 |issue=3â€“5 |pages=409â€“446 |doi=10.1163/22134808-00002554 |pmid=31287075 |access-date=December 16, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds, here represented using the vowels of [[Received Pronunciation]], with [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|effects of {{angbr|r}}]] ignored and mergers in [[General American]] mentioned where relevant:
*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/Ã¦/}} as in ''pad''
*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/É‘Ë/}} as in ''father''â€”merged with {{IPAslink|É’}} as {{IPAslink|É‘}} in [[General American]]â€”which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound{{sfn|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}
*the [[open back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/É’/}} (merged with {{IPA|/É‘Ë/}} as {{IPAslink|É‘}} in [[General American]]) in ''was'' and ''what''{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}
*the [[open-mid back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/É”Ë/}} in ''water''
*the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/eÉª/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'', usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letterâ€”this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]]
*a [[schwa]] {{IPA|/É™/}} in many unstressed syllables, as in ''about'', ''comma'', ''solar''

The double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as ''Aaron'' and ''[[aardvark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.

{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}, as well as in French; it is the second most common in Spanish, and the most common in Portuguese. {{angbr|a}} represents approximately 8.2% of letters as used in English texts;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Letter frequency (English) |url=http://en.algoritmy.net/article/40379/Letter-frequency-English |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210304152631/http://en.algoritmy.net/article/40379/Letter-frequency-English |archive-date=2021-03-04 |access-date=2022-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the figure is around 7.6% in French&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Corpus de Thomas TempÃ© |url=http://gpl.insa-lyon.fr/Dvorak-Fr/CorpusDeThomasTemp%C3%A9 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930194046/http://gpl.insa-lyon.fr/Dvorak-Fr/CorpusDeThomasTemp%C3%A9 |archive-date=2007-09-30 |access-date=2007-06-15 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11.5% in Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pratt |first=Fletcher |title=Secret and Urgent: The story of codes and ciphers |publisher=Blue Ribbon |year=1942 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=254â€“5 |oclc=795065}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14.6% in Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=FrequÃªncia da ocorrÃªncia de letras no PortuguÃªs |url=http://www.numaboa.com/criptografia/criptoanalise/310-Frequencia-no-Portugues |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803182254/http://www.numaboa.com/criptografia/criptoanalise/310-Frequencia-no-Portugues |archive-date=2009-08-03 |access-date=2009-06-16 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other languages ===
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|a}} denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as {{IPAslink|a}}, {{IPAslink|Ã¤}}, or {{IPAslink|É‘}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}}â€”and the glyph {{angbr|[[Ã]]}}â€”stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.

=== Other systems ===
* In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr IPA|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr IPA|Ã¤}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]], and {{angbr IPA|É‘}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
* In [[X-SAMPA]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|A}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

== Other uses ==
{{Main|A (disambiguation)}}
* When using [[base-16]] notation, A is the conventional numeral corresponding to the number 10.
* In [[algebra]], the letter ''a'' along with various other letters of the alphabet is often used to denote a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics. In 1637, [[RenÃ© Descartes]] &quot;invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x, y, and z, and knowns by a, b, and c&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sorell, ''Descartes: A Very Short Introduction'', (2000). New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and this convention is still often followed, especially in elementary algebra.
* In [[geometry]], capital Latin letters are used to denote objects including [[line segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, and [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]]{{sfn|Diringer|2000|p=1}} A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.{{sfn|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}
* A is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: Aâˆ’, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; &quot;A grade&quot; for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.{{sfn|Ciani|Sheldon|2010|pp=99â€“100}}
* A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,{{sfn|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}} or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Luciani |first=JenÃ© |title=The Bra Book: The Fashion Formula to Finding the Perfect Bra |year=2009 |publisher=Benbella |isbn=978-1-933-77194-6 |location=Dallas |pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other representations ==
=== Computing &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot; id=&quot;Computing codes&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ===
The Latin letters {{angbr|A}} and {{angbr|a}} have [[Unicode]] encodings {{unichar|0041|Latin letter capital A}} and {{unichar|0061|Latin small letter a}}. These are the same [[code point]]s as were used in [[ASCII]] and [[ISO 8859]]. There are also [[precomposed character]] encodings for {{angbr|A}} and {{angbr|a}} with diacritics, for most of those listed [[#Related characters in the Latin alphabet|above]]; the remainder are produced using [[combining diacritic]]s.

Variant forms of the letter have unique code points for specialist use: the [[Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols|alphanumeric symbols set]] in mathematics and science, [[Latin alpha]] in linguistics, and [[halfwidth and fullwidth forms]] for legacy CJK font compatibility. The Cyrillic and Greek [[homoglyph]]s of the Latin {{angbr|A}} have separate encodings {{unichar|0410|Cyrillic capital letter Ð|nlink=A (Cyrillic)}} and {{unichar|0391|Greek capital letter alpha|nlink=Alpha}}.

Within Alabama, [[American football]], particularly at the [[college football|college]] level, plays a major part of the state's culture. 

Originally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Spain held Mobile as part of [[Spanish West Florida]] until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major [[Cotton production in the United States|producer of cotton]], and widely used [[African Americans|African American]] [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor. In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the [[Confederate States of America]], with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868. Following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship, in part due to agriculture and a few [[cash crops]] being the main driver of the state's economy. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] from the late 19th century up until the 1960s. High-profile events such as the [[Selma to Montgomery march]] made the state a major focal point of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

During and after [[World War II]], Alabama grew as the state's [[Economic diversity|economy diversified]] with new industries. [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in Huntsville would help Alabama's economic growth in the mid-to-late 20th century, by developing an [[aerospace]] industry. Alabama's economy in the 21st century is based on automotive, finance, tourism, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008â€“2018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state was derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the [[confluence]] of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is {{lang|akz|Albaamo}} (or variously {{lang|akz|Albaama}} or {{lang|akz|AlbÃ amo}} in different dialects; the plural form is {{lang|akz|Albaamaha}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Sylestine, Cora |author2=Hardy, Heather |author3=[[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archive-date=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/statenam.html |title=Alabama: The State Name |access-date=August 2, 2007 |website=All About Alabama |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628215841/http://www.archives.alabama.gov/statenam.html |archive-date=June 28, 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first usage appears in three accounts of the [[Hernando de Soto]] expedition of 1540: [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso de la Vega]] used {{lang|es|Alibamo}}, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote ''Alibamu'' and ''Limamu'', respectively, in [[transliteration]]s of the term.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt; As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the {{lang|fr|Alibamon}}, with French maps identifying the river as {{lang|fr|RiviÃ¨re des Alibamons}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;/&gt; Other spellings of the name have included ''Alibamu'', ''Alabamo'', ''Albama'', ''Alebamon'', ''Alibama'', ''Alibamou'', ''Alabamu'', and ''Allibamou''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wills&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wills |first=Charles A. |title=A Historical Album of Alabama |year=1995 |publisher=The Millbrook Press |isbn=978-1-56294-591-6 |oclc=32242468 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalalbumo0000will_y2e2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Griffith |first=Lucille |title=Alabama: A Documentary History to 1900|year=1972 |publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-0371-6 |oclc=17530914}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of state names derived from [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] is common in the U.S.; an estimated 26 states have names of Native American origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiss&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weiss |first=Sonia |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Baby Names |year=1999 |publisher=Macmillan USA |isbn=978-0-02-863367-1 |oclc=222611214 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00weis_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moundville Archaeological Site Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in Hale County. It was occupied by Native Americans of the [[Mississippian culture]] from 1000 to 1450 CE.]]

[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period (1000{{spaces}}BCE{{snd}}700{{spaces}}CE) and continued until [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimesAlmanac&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |title=Alabama |date=August 11, 2006 |work=The New York Times Almanac 2004 |access-date=September 23, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016195242/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian [[Mississippian culture]] covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 CE, with one of its major centers built at what is now the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Welch |first= Paul D. |title= Moundville's Economy |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1991 |isbn= 978-0-8173-0512-3 |oclc= 21330955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Walthall |first= John A. |title= Prehistoric Indians of the Southeast-Archaeology of Alabama and the Middle South |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1990 |isbn= 978-0-8173-0552-9 |oclc= 26656858}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after [[Cahokia]] in present-day [[Illinois]], which was the center of the culture.

The Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during their exploration of North America in the 16th century. The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through [[Mabila]] and other parts of the state in 1540.

After the French lost to the British in the [[Seven Years' War]], it became part of British [[West Florida]] from 1763 to 1783.

By 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were [[free people of color]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adahtmln&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/timeline/al1801.html |title=Alabama History Timeline |website=Alabama Department of Archives and History |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012 |archive-date=June 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618035649/http://www.archives.alabama.gov/timeline/al1801.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the [[Confederate States of America]]. The Confederacy's capital was initially at Montgomery. Alabama was heavily [[Alabama in the American Civil War|involved in the American Civil War]]. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.

From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: [[Jeremiah Haralson]], [[Benjamin S. Turner]], and [[James T.

Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During Reconstruction, state legislators ratified a [[Constitution of Alabama|new state constitution]] in 1868 which created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and [[misappropriation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; Organized [[Insurgency|insurgent]], resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans.

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875,&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; and the legislature passed the [[Blaine Amendment]], prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |title=A Blaine Amendment Update (July 00) |publisher=Schoolreport.com |access-date=June 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716014339/http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, legislation was approved that called for [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classroomhelp.com/till/jimcrowlaws/jimcrowalabama.html |title=Jim Crow Laws in Alabama |website=Emmett Till, It All Began with a Whistle |publisher=Classroomhelp |access-date=September 22, 2012 |archive-date=June 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626210219/http://classroomhelp.com/till/jimcrowlaws/jimcrowalabama.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Birmingham Alabama skyline 1915.jpg|thumb|The developing skyline of Birmingham in 1915]]

The new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for [[voter registration]] that effectively [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor European Americans, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]] and [[literacy test]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Kousser. ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903 only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were [[Literacy|literate]]. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt;

While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all Blacks had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1248 |title=Segregation (Jim Crow) |website=Encyclopedia of Alabama |access-date=May 26, 2018 |archive-date=May 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530141129/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1248 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title= The Black Belt |access-date= September 23, 2006 |date= April 19, 2004 |journal= Southern Spaces |publisher= Emory University |doi= 10.18737/M70K6P |last1= Tullos |first1= Allen |doi-access= free |archive-date= January 11, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110111023122/http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the [[Rosenwald Fund]] began funding the construction of what came to be known as [[Rosenwald School]]s. In Alabama, these schools were designed, and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenwaldal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings MPS |website=National Register Information System |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/64500011_text |access-date=October 3, 2012 |archive-date=June 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220607152915/https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/64500011_text |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued racial discrimination and [[lynching]]s, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hine |first1=Darlene |last2=Hine |first2=William |last3=Harrold |first3=Stanley |title=African Americans: A Concise History |date=2012 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Boston |isbn=9780205806270 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388 388â€“389] |edition=4th |url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration |title=Great Migration {{!}} African-American history |work=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |access-date=May 26, 2018 |archive-date=May 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527024942/https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;historical populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;census data&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |title=Resident Population Dataâ€”2010 Census |publisher=2010.census.gov |access-date=January 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519131122/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |archive-date=May 19, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. The legislature also changed the boundaries of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]] to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]], containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature.

During the 1960s, under Governor [[George Wallace]], Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5JJCAAAQBAJ&amp;q=alabama+brown+v.+board&amp;pg=PT94 |title=Brown v.

Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221054512/http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archive-date=February 21, 2007 |title=Voting Rights |access-date=September 23, 2006 |date=January 9, 2002 |website=Civil Rights: Law and History |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', by 2017, many of Alabama's African Americans were living in Alabama's cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery. Also, the Black Belt region across central Alabama &quot;is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American. These counties include Dallas, [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes]], [[Marengo County, Alabama|Marengo]] and [[Perry County, Alabama|Perry]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Alabama Senate Race Between Roy Moore and Doug Jones Ends With More Controversy |first1=Jonathan |last1=Martin |first2=Alan |last2=Blinder |date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot; /&gt; Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.

Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot; /&gt;

As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use [[limited voting]], as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;cum&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004) |url=http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 |publisher=FairVote Archives |access-date=January 11, 2015 |archive-date=February 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203203843/http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the state's economy shifted away from its traditional lumber, steel, and textile industries because of increased foreign competition. Steel jobs, for instance, declined from 46,314 in 1950 to 14,185 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridges |first1=Edwin |title=Alabama: The Making of an American State |date=2016 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the state, particularly Huntsville, benefited from the opening of the [[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] in 1960, a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle. Technology and manufacturing industries, such as automobile assembly, replaced some the state's older industries in the late twentieth century, but the state's economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area, such as Georgia and Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridges |first1=Edwin |title=Alabama: The Making of an American State |date=2016 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |pages=224â€“229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===
In 2001, Alabama Supreme Court chief justice [[Roy Moore]] installed a statue of the [[Ten Commandments]] in the capitol in Montgomery. In 2002, the 11th US Circuit Court ordered the statue removed, but Moore refused to follow the court order, which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument. The monument was removed in August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Faulk |first1=Kent |title=A Roy Moore timeline: From Ten Commandments to senate candidate |url=https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2016/05/a_roy_moore_timeline_from_ten.html |website=al.com |access-date=February 6, 2021 |date=May 8, 2016 |archive-date=August 13, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200813094511/https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2016/05/a_roy_moore_timeline_from_ten.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few natural disasters have occurred in the state in the twenty-first century. In 2004, [[Hurricane Ivan]], a category 3 storm upon landfall, struck the state and caused over $18&amp;nbsp;billion of damage.

[[File:Phil Campbell tornado damage.jpg|thumb|left|Tornado damage in [[Phil Campbell, Alabama|Phil Campbell]] following the statewide [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 27, 2011, tornado outbreak]]]]
Alabama, along with [[Oklahoma]] and [[Iowa]], has the most confirmed [[Fujita scale|F5]] and [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5]] tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LIST: States with the most F5/EF5 tornadoes since 1950; Ohio high on list |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes |access-date=April 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232719/http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes |archive-date=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. The state was affected by the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oliver |first=Mike |title=April 27's record tally: 62 tornadoes in Alabama |date=August 4, 2011 |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/08/april_27s_record_tally_62_torn.html |publisher=al.com |access-date=November 4, 2012 |archive-date=November 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109185256/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/08/april_27s_record_tally_62_torn.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring. The northern partâ€”along the Tennessee River Valleyâ€”is most vulnerable. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the Southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|Â°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|Â°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Alabama's highest temperature of {{convert|112|Â°F}} was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of [[Centerville, Alabama|Centerville]]. The record low of {{convert|-27|Â°F}} occurred on January 30, 1966, in [[New Market, Alabama|New Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |title=Record high and low temperatures for all 50 states |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=accuracyproject.org |access-date=November 3, 2012 |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform |publisher=Constitutionalreform.org |access-date=October 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915165938/http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |archive-date=September 15, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have argued that Alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. The former constitution was particularly criticized for its complexity and length intentionally codifying segregation and racism.

[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]
Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[Legislature|legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''Reynolds v. Sims'' (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.

At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.

[[File:Governor Kay Ivey 2017 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]] is the [[governor of Alabama]] as of 2024.]]
The [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[List of governors of Alabama|governor of Alabama]]. Other members of the executive branch include the cabinet, the [[List of lieutenant governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor of Alabama]], the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Secretary of State of Alabama|Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]]. The current governor is Republican [[Kay Ivey]].

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |title=Alabama's Legislative Process |first=McDowell |last=Lee |year=2009 |publisher=State of Alabama |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102162559/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |archive-date=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[judiciary]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Constitution of Alabama]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJS&quot;&gt;[http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL Judicial Selection in the States: Alabama] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006162358/http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL |date=October 6, 2014}}, American Judicature Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[chief justice]] of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican [[Tom Parker (judge)|Tom Parker]].

=== County and local governments ===
{{See also|List of counties in Alabama}}
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=300}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.

The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;/&gt; Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''Baker v. Carr'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, to implement the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;. Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.

&quot;The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153 | title=Home Rule | first=Albert P. | last=Brewer | publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Alabama]] | access-date=February 4, 2015 | archive-date=February 3, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203220653/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
During Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud, and intimidation. After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation. Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor George Wallace, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot; /&gt; and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member district]]s that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.

In 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David |date=November 2, 2010 |work=[[The Birmingham News]] |access-date=July 9, 2018 |archive-date=July 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709153753/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2023|February|}}, there are a total of 3,707,233 registered voters, with 3,318,679 active, and the others inactive in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |access-date=March 2, 2023 |archive-date=December 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208174821/http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elections ===
{{Main|Elections in Alabama}}
[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] won a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election]] in 2017.]]

==== State elections ====
With the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the general election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.

Members of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-date=May 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506035723/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry Hooper Sr.|Perry O. Hooper Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=April 26, 2016|title=Chief Justice Perry Hooper remembered as GOP pioneer|url=https://www.al.com/news/2016/04/alabama_chief_justice_perry_ho.html|access-date=April 2, 2021|website=al|archive-date=June 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210613164025/https://www.al.com/news/2016/04/alabama_chief_justice_perry_ho.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission, was defeated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |access-date=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archive-date=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archive-date=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |access-date=June 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archive-date=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are [[Steve Windom]] (1999â€“2003), [[Kay Ivey]] (2011â€“2017), and [[Will Ainsworth]] (2019â€“present).

==== Local elections ====
Many local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, mayors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mayor's Office {{!}} City of Montgomery, AL |url=https://www.montgomeryal.gov/government/city-government/mayor-s-office |access-date=April 16, 2023 |website=www.montgomeryal.gov |language=en |archive-date=April 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230416204527/https://www.montgomeryal.gov/government/city-government/mayor-s-office |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mayor |url=https://www.tuscaloosa.com/government/mayor |access-date=April 16, 2023 |website=City of Tuscaloosa |language=en |archive-date=April 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230416204526/https://www.tuscaloosa.com/government/mayor |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many metropolitan and suburban counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly most rural counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary. However, since local governments in Alabama are weaker than in other parts of the country, Republicans have the upper hand in government.

Alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Republicans retain the vast majority of those posts. The current split is 18 [[Alabama Democratic Party|Democrats]], and 49 [[Alabama Republican Party|Republicans]] as of 2023. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over urban and more populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more rural counties with lower population. The state of Alabama has and 11 African-American sheriffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sheriffs Directory â€“ Alabama Sheriffs Association â€“ Alabama |url=https://www.alabamasheriffs.com/sheriffs-directory |access-date=April 16, 2023 |website=www.alabamasheriffs.com |archive-date=May 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230530115854/https://www.alabamasheriffs.com/sheriffs-directory |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal elections ====
The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Katie Britt]] and [[Tommy Tuberville]], both of whom are Republican. In the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: ([[Jerry Carl]], [[Mike Rogers (Alabama politician)|Mike Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Dale Strong]], [[Barry Moore (Alabama politician)|Barry Moore]], and [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]]) and one Democrat: [[Terri Sewell]], who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Montgomery.

=== Primary and secondary education ===
[[File:Vestavia Hills High School.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vestavia Hills High School]] in the suburbs of Birmingham]]

Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/Pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?FilterField1=ID&amp;FilterValue1=7 |title=Alabama Education Quick Facts 2012â€“13 |access-date=April 29, 2014 |format=PDF |archive-date=April 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429203418/http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/Pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?FilterField1=ID&amp;FilterValue1=7 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006â€“2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama's high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]] and Mississippi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf |title=Educational Attainment : 2000 : Census 2000 Brief |website=Census.gov |access-date=December 29, 2016 |archive-date=April 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416222303/https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513164857/http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}.

Generally prohibited in the West at large, [[school corporal punishment]] is not unusual in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students [[paddle (spanking)|paddled]] at least one time, according to government data for the 2011â€“2012 school year.{{efn|This figure refers to only the number of students paddled, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be higher.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot; /&gt; The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed by only Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corpun.com/counuss.htm |title=Corporal punishment in US schools |publisher=[[World Corporal Punishment Research]] |last=Farrell |first=Colin |date=February 2016 |access-date=April 4, 2016 |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403071606/http://www.corpun.com/counuss.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) ([[University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine|University of Alabama School of Medicine]], University of South Alabama and [[Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine]] and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicineâ€”Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges (Auburn University and [[Tuskegee University]]), a dental school ([[UAB School of Dentistry|University of Alabama School of Dentistry]]), an optometry college (University of Alabama at Birmingham), two pharmacy schools (Auburn University and [[Samford University]]), and five law schools ([[University of Alabama School of Law]], [[Birmingham School of Law]], [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Miles Law School]], and the [[Thomas Goode Jones School of Law]]). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the [[Alabama Commission on Higher Education]] and the Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ache&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Alabama Commission on Higher Education |title=Directory of Alabama Colleges and Universities |url=http://www.ache.alabama.gov/Colleges&amp;Universities/Directory.htm |access-date=July 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002457/http://www.ache.alabama.gov/Colleges%26Universities/Directory.htm |archive-date=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aviation ===
{{Main|Aviation in Alabama}}

Major airports with sustained operations in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]]&lt;!--no longer Muscle Shoals Aux--&gt; (MSL) and [[Northeast Alabama Regional Airport]] (GAD).

=== Rail ===
{{Alabama rail network}}
For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the ''[[Crescent (train)|Crescent]]'', a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at [[Anniston station|Anniston]], [[Birmingham station (Alabama)|Birmingham]], and [[Tuscaloosa station|Tuscaloosa]].

=== Roads ===
Alabama has six major interstate routes: [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]] (I-65) travels northâ€“south roughly through the middle of the state; [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|I-20]]/[[Interstate 59 in Alabama|I-59]] travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards [[Atlanta]]; [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|I-85]] originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. [[Interstate 22 in Alabama|I-22]] enters the state from Mississippi and connects Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: [[Interstate 165 (Alabama)|I-165]] in Mobile, [[Interstate 359|I-359]] in Tuscaloosa, [[Interstate 459|I-459]] around Birmingham, [[Interstate 565|I-565]] in Decatur and Huntsville, and [[Interstate 759|I-759]] in Gadsden. A sixth route, [[Interstate 685 (Alabama)|I-685]], will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as [[Interstate 422|I-422]]. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, [[Interstate 222|I-222]] has been proposed, as well.

Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11 in Alabama|U.S. Route 11]] (US-11), [[U.S. Route 29 in Alabama|US-29]], [[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|US-31]], [[U.S. Route 43 in Alabama|US-43]], [[U.S. Route 45 in Alabama|US-45]], [[U.S. Route 72 in Alabama|US-72]], [[U.S. Route 78 in Alabama|US-78]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Alabama|US-80]], [[U.S. Route 82 in Alabama|US-82]], [[U.S. Route 84 in Alabama|US-84]], [[U.S. Route 90 in Alabama|US-90]], [[U.S. Route 98 in Alabama|US-98]], [[U.S. Route 231 in Alabama|US-231]], [[U.S. Route 278 in Alabama|US-278]], [[U.S. Route 280 in Alabama|US-280]], [[U.S. Route 331 in Alabama|US-331]], [[U.S. Route 411 in Alabama|US-411]], and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|US-431]].

There are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery; Northport/Tuscaloosa Western Bypass in Tuscaloosa and [[Northport, Alabama|Northport]]; Emerald Mountain Expressway in Wetumpka; and Beach Express in [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]].

=== Ports ===
The [[Port of Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the Gulf of Mexico with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennesseeâ€“Tombigbee Waterway]]. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonstraffic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Table 1086.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' ({{IPAc-en|É™|Ëˆ|k|Éª|l|iË|z}} {{respell|É™|KIL|eez}}) or '''Achilleus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:á¼ˆÏ‡Î¹Î»Î»ÎµÏÏ‚|á¼ˆÏ‡Î¹Î»Î»ÎµÏÏ‚]]|AchilleÃºs}}) was a hero of the [[Trojan War]] who was known as being the greatest of all the Greek warriors. A central character in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', he was the son of the [[Nereids|Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], king of [[Phthia]] and famous [[Argonauts|Argonaut]]. Achilles was raised in Phthia along with his childhood companion [[Patroclus]] and received his education by the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]]. In the ''Iliad'', he is presented as the commander of the mythical tribe of the [[Myrmidons]]. 

Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince [[Hector]] outside the gates of [[Troy]]. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the ''Iliad'', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with [[Statius]]' unfinished epic ''[[Achilleid]]'', written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel. According to that myth, when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river [[Styx]] as an infant, she held him by one of his heels leaving it untouched by the waters and thus his only vulnerable body part. 

Alluding to these legends, the term &quot;[[Achilles' heel]]&quot; has come to mean a point of weakness which can lead to downfall, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The [[Achilles tendon]] is named after him following the same legend.

== Etymology ==

[[Linear B]] tablets attest to the personal name ''Achilleus'' in the forms ''a-ki-re-u'' and ''a-ki-re-we'',&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author1=Dorothea Sigel|title=Achilles|author2=Anne Ley|author3=Bruno Bleckmann|entry=Achilles|encyclopedia=Brill's New Pauly|editor=Hubert Cancik |display-editors=etal |publisher=Brill Reference Online|doi=10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e102220}} Retrieved 5 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being the [[dative case|dative]] of the former.&lt;ref name=Beekes/&gt; The name grew more popular, becoming common soon after the seventh century BC&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111126201849/http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/search?patt=*AXIL&amp;first=250 Epigraphical database] gives 476 matches for á¼ˆÏ‡Î¹Î»-.The earliest ones: [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=27810&amp;bookid=6&amp;region=2&amp;subregion=1 Corinth 7th c.

Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{lang|grc|á¼„Ï‡Î¿Ï‚}} (''{{transliteration|grc|Ã¡chos}}'') &quot;distress, pain, sorrow, grief&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Liddell |first1=Henry George |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3D*)axilleu%2Fs |title=An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1889 |via=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholia to the ''Iliad'', 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|Î»Î±ÏŒÏ‚}} (''{{transliteration|grc|laÃ³s}}'') &quot;people, soldiers, nation&quot;, resulting in a proto-form ''*AkhÃ­-lÄuÌ¯os'' &quot;he who has the people distressed&quot; or &quot;he whose people have distress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard Palmer|title=The Interpretation of Mycenaean Greek Texts|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1963|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nagy&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory Nagy|title=The best of the Achaeans|url=http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5442|website=CHS|publisher=The Center for Hellenic Studies, Harvard University|access-date=19 March 2015|archive-date=2 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402115312/http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5442|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|achilles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (and frequently by Achilles himself). Achilles' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of {{lang|grc|ÎºÎ»Î­Î¿Ï‚}} ''{{transliteration|grc|klÃ©os}}'' (&quot;glory&quot;, usually in war). Furthermore, ''laÃ³s'' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following [[Leonard Palmer]], to mean &quot;a corps of soldiers&quot;, a [[muster (military)|muster]].&lt;ref name=Nagy/&gt; With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

Some researchers deem the name a [[loan word]], possibly from a [[Pre-Greek]] language.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;/&gt; Achilles' descent from the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and a similarity of his name with those of [[Potamoi|river deities]] such as [[Acheron]] and [[Achelous]] have led to speculations about his being an old [[Greek sea gods|water divinity]] {{see below|{{section link||Worship and heroic cult}}, below}}.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the supportive position of {{cite journal|author=Hildebrecht Hommel|title=Der Gott Achilleus|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften|issue=1|year=1980|pages=38â€“44}}&amp;nbsp;â€“ A critical point of view is taken by {{cite journal|author=J.

Beekes]] has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name, based among other things on the coexistence of ''-Î»Î»-'' and ''-Î»-'' in epic language, which may account for a palatalized phoneme /l&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;/ in the original language.&lt;ref name=Beekes&gt;Robert S.

== Birth and early years ==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 181.jpg|thumb|''Thetis Dipping the Infant Achilles into the River Styx'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] ({{c.|1625|lk=no}}; [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], Rotterdam)|left|241x241px]]
Achilles was the son of [[Thetis]]{{Mdash}}a [[Nereid]] and daughter of the [[Old Man of the Sea]]{{Mdash}}and [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for Thetis's hand in marriage until [[Prometheus]], the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by [[Themis]], goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755â€“768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34â€“37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26â€“47; Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.5; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the ''[[Argonautica]]'' (4.760) Zeus' sister and wife [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god [[Nereus]], was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Education of Achilles 1862 Delacroix.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'', by [[EugÃ¨ne Delacroix]], pastel on paper, {{c.|1862|lk=no}} ([[Getty Center]], Los Angeles)]]
According to the ''[[Achilleid]]'', written by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD, and to [[Lost literary work|non-surviving previous sources]], when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Achilleid'' 1.269; Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Jonathan S.

It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869â€“879.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'' ({{Circa|1772}}), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] ([[Yale Center for British Art]])]]None of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'', Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaios]], son of [[Pelagon]], challenged Achilles by the river [[Scamander]]. He was ambidextrous, and cast a spear from each hand; one grazed Achilles' elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Homer (Robert Fagles translation) |title=The Iliad |page=525 |quote=But the other (spear) grazed Achilles' strong right arm and dark blood gushed as the spear shot past his back}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the few fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] which describe the hero's death (i.e. the ''[[Cypria]]'', the ''[[Little Iliad]]'' by [[Lesches|Lesches of Pyrrha]], the ''[[Aethiopis]]'' and ''[[Iliupersis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]]), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel. In the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his torso.

Peleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]], who lived on [[Mount Pelion]] and was known as the most righteous of the [[Centaur|Centaurs]], to be reared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87â€“89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830â€“832.&lt;/ref&gt; In some accounts, Achilles' original name was &quot;Ligyron&quot; and he was later named ''Achilles'' by his tutor Chiron.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, Library, Book III [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.13&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 3.13.6]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Homer, Achilles grew up in [[Phthia]] with his childhood companion [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot; /&gt; Homer further writes that Achilles taught Patroclus what he himself had been taught by Chiron, including the medical arts.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'' [[wikisource:The_Iliad_(Murray)/Book_XI|Book XI 822-836]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan War.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.410ff.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Achilleus Lyra.jpg|thumb|[[Chiron]] teaching Achilles how to play the [[lyre]], Roman [[fresco]] from [[Herculaneum]], 1st century AD]]

According to [[Photius]], the sixth book of the ''New History'' by [[Ptolemy Hephaestion]] reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus. When she had Achilles, Peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur Chiron. Later Chiron exhumed the body of the [[Damysus (Giant)|Damysus]], who was the fastest of all the giants, removed the ankle, and incorporated it into Achilles' burnt foot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_copyright/photius_05bibliotheca.htm Photius, ''Bibliotheca'', cod. 190]: &quot;Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; six were born; when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed and tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to Chiron.  The latter exhumed the body of the giant Damysos who was buried at Palleneâ€”Damysos was the fastest of all the giantsâ€”removed the 'astragale' and incorporated it into Achilles' foot using 'ingredients'.  This 'astragale' fell when Achilles was pursued by Apollo and it was thus that Achilles, fallen, was killed.  It is said, on the other hand, that he was called Podarkes by the Poet, because, it is said, Thetis gave the newborn child the wings of Arce and Podarkes means that his feet had the wings of Arce.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical description ===
In the account of [[Dares Phrygius|Dares the Phrygian]], Achilles was described having &quot;... a large chest, a fine mouth, and powerfully formed arms and legs. His head was covered with long wavy chestnut-colored hair. Though mild in manner, he was very fierce in battle. His face showed the joy of a man richly endowed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dares Phrygius]], ''History of the Fall of Troy'' [https://www.theoi.com/Text/DaresPhrygius.html 13]&lt;/ref&gt; Homer described Achilles, along with numerous other characters, as being [[blond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Myres&quot;&gt;Myres, John Linton (1967). ''Who were the Greeks?'', pp. 192â€“199. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other names ===
Among the appellations under which Achilles is generally known are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|{{Cite book|title=A Classical Manual: Being a Mythological, Historical and Geographical Commentary on Pope's Homer, and Dryden's Aeneid of Virgil, with a Copious Index|last=Murray|first=John|year=1833|location=Albemarle Street, London|page=3}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pyrisous''', &quot;saved from the fire&quot;, his first name, which seems to favour the tradition in which his mortal parts were burned by his mother Thetis
* '''Aeacides''', from his grandfather [[Aeacus]]
* '''Aemonius''', from Aemonia, a country which afterwards acquired the name of Thessaly
* '''Aspetos''', &quot;inimitable&quot; or &quot;vast&quot;, his name at [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]]
* '''Larissaeus''', from [[Larissa Cremaste|Larissa]] (also called Cremaste), a town of Achaia Phthiotis in Thessaly
* '''Ligyron''', his original name
* '''Nereius''', from his mother Thetis, one of the [[Nereid]]s
* '''Pelides''', from his father, [[Peleus]]
* '''Phthius''', from his birthplace, [[Phthia]]
* '''Podarkes''', &quot;swift-footed&quot; (literally, &quot;defending with the foot&quot;, from the verb á¼€ÏÎºÎ­Ï‰, &quot;to defend, ward off&quot;); Ptolemy Hephaestion, alternatively, says that it was due to the wings of [[Arke]] being attached to his feet.&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 6 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190) (trans. Pearse) (Greek mythographer C1st to C2nd A.D.) :

&quot;It is said . . . that he [Akhilleus (Achilles)] was called Podarkes (Podarces, Swift-Footed) by the Poet [i.e. Homer], because, it is said, Thetis gave the newborn child the wings of Arke (Arce) and Podarkes means that his feet had the wings of Arke. And Arke was the daughter of Thaumas and her sister was Iris; both had wings, but, during the struggle of the gods against the Titanes (Titans), Arke flew out of the camp of the gods and joined the Titanes. After the victory Zeus removed her wings before throwing her into Tartaros and, when he came to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, he brought these wings as a gift for Thetis.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hidden on Skyros ===

[[File:Gaziantep Zeugma Museum Achilles mosaic in 2011 2098.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman mosaic]] from the Poseidon Villa in [[Zeugma, Commagene]] (now in the [[Zeugma Mosaic Museum]]) depicting Achilles disguised as a woman and [[Odysseus]] tricking him into revealing himself]]

Some post-Homeric sources&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Skyrioi'', surviving only in fragmentary form; [[Philostratus III|Philostratus Junior]], ''Imagines'' i; Scholiast on Homer's ''Iliad'', 9.326; [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 13.162â€“180; Ovid, ''[[Tristia]]'' 2.409â€“412 (mentioning a Roman tragedy on this subject); Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.8; [[Statius]], ''[[Achilleid]]'' 1.689â€“880, 2.167ff.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man dressed as a princess or at least a girl at the court of [[Lycomedes (mythology)|Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]].

There, Achilles, properly disguised, lived among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;[[Pyrrha (mythology)|Pyrrha]]&quot; (the red-haired girl), Cercysera or Aissa (&quot;swift&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Graves|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Graves|title=The Greek Myths - The Complete and Definitive Edition|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|year=2017|isbn=9780241983386|pages=Index s.v.

According to this story, Odysseus learned from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus went to Skyros in the guise of a pedlar selling women's clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly took up the spear, Odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women. While the women fled in panic, Achilles prepared to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.

== In the Trojan War ==
[[File:Achilles by Lycomedes Louvre Ma2120.jpg|thumb|A marble representation of Achilles at the court of King [[Lycomedes]], ca. 240 CE.|306x306px]]
According to the ''Iliad'', Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 [[Myrmidons]]. He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, [[Eudoros|Eudorus]], Peisander, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and Alcimedon.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 16.168â€“197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telephus ===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;. Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]], where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epitome 3.20&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pseudo-Apollodorus|title=Bibliotheca, Epitome 3.20|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApollodorusE.html#69|website=theoi.com|ref=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' [[Lost literary work|lost play]] about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epitome 3.20&quot; /&gt;

=== Troilus ===

[[File:Achilles slaying Troilus.PNG|thumb|left|Achilles slaying Troilus, red-figure kylix signed by [[Euphronios]]]]
According to the ''[[Cypria]]'' (the part of the [[Epic Cycle]] that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' wrath), when the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of [[Aeneas]], sacked neighbouring cities (like [[Pedasus]] and [[Lyrnessus]], where the Greeks capture the queen [[Briseis]]) and killed [[Tenes]], a son of [[Apollo]], as well as Priam's son [[Troilus]] in the sanctuary of [[Apollo]] [[Thymbra]]ios; however, the romance between Troilus and [[Chryseis]] described in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' and in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' is a medieval invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;stoa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |title=Proclus' Summary of the Cypria |publisher=Stoa.org |access-date=9 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009120320/http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |archive-date=9 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot; /&gt;

Cf. [[Vergil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' 1.474â€“478.&lt;/ref&gt; Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister [[Polyxena]], and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth&amp;nbsp;â€“ who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo [[Thymbra]]ios.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca Epitome'' 3.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia to [[Lycophron]] 307; [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], Scholia to the ''Aeneid'' 1.474.&lt;/ref&gt; In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n14/davi02_.html &quot;Zeus Be Nice Now&quot;] in ''London Review of Books'', 19 July 2007. Retrieved 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents.

[[File:Achilles Agamemnon Pompei mosaic NAMNaples 10006.jpg|thumb|Achilles and [[Agamemnon]], from a [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD]]
Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath (Î¼á¿†Î½Î¹Ï‚ á¼ˆÏ‡Î¹Î»Î»Î­Ï‰Ï‚, ''mÃªnis AchillÃ©Ås'') is the central theme of the poem. The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:

The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' slave [[Briseis]], the daughter of [[Briseus]], be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis),&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.334â€“343.&lt;/ref&gt; with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles [[Homeric prayer|prays]] to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour.

As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains, [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]]. They promise that, if Achilles returns to battle, Agamemnon will return the captive Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he is planning to do.

The Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle, wearing Achilles' armour, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades [[Hephaestus]] to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail in the poem.

Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god [[Scamander]], who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey.

[[File:The_Triumph_of_Achilles_by_Franz_von_Matsch.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|''The Triumph of Achilles'', fresco by [[Franz von Matsch]] in the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], [[Greece]].]]

Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that &quot;my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw â€“ such agonies you have caused me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Iliad&quot;, Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991: 22.346.&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of [[funeral games]] in honour of his companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lattimore |first1=Richmond |title=The Illiad of Homer |date=2011 |publisher=The University of Chicago |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-46937-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/iliad00home_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the onset of his duel with Hector, Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky, which comes on in the autumn, Orion's dog ([[Sirius]]); a sign of evil. During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to [[Hesperus]], the evening/western star ([[Venus]]), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]], the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended).

With the assistance of the god [[Hermes]] (Argeiphontes), Hector's father [[Priam]] goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th (in the tradition of [[Niobe]]'s offspring). The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.

=== Later epic accounts: fighting Penthesilea and Memnon ===

[[File:Akhilleus Memnon Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1410.jpg|thumb|Achilles and Memnon fighting, between Thetis and Eos, Attic black-figure amphora, {{Circa|510 BC}}, from Vulci]]

The ''[[Aethiopis]]'' (7th century BC) and a work named ''[[Posthomerica]]'', composed by [[Quintus of Smyrna]] in the fourth century CE, relate further events from the [[Trojan War]]. When [[Penthesilea]], queen of the [[Amazons]] and daughter of [[Ares]], arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Propertius]], 3.11.15; [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially taken aback, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.

Following the death of Patroclus, Nestor's son [[Antilochus]] becomes Achilles' closest companion. When [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], son of the Dawn Goddess [[Eos]] and king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]], slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad''{{'}}s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century BC. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

=== Achilles and Patroclus ===
{{main|Achilles and Patroclus}}
[[File:Akhilleus Patroklos Antikensammlung Berlin F2278.jpg|thumb|Achilles tending Patroclus wounded by an arrow, Attic red-figure [[kylix]], {{Circa|500 BC}} ([[Altes Museum]], Berlin)]]

The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'', it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus had sexual relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Tribal Imagination: Civilization and the Savage Mind |author= Robin Fox |year= 2011 |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674060944 |quote= There is certainly no evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers.|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCxy_4Bt1F0C&amp;pg=PA223 223]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life|last= Martin |first= Thomas R |year= 2012 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0521148443 |quote= The ancient sources do not report, however, what modern scholars have asserted: that Alexander and his very close friend Hephaestion were lovers. Achilles and his equally close friend Patroclus provided the legendary model for this friendship, but Homer in the ''Iliad'' never suggested that they had sex with each other. (That came from later authors.)|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no direct evidence in the text of the ''Iliad'' that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from [[classical antiquity]] to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of ''paiderasteia'']], which is the relationship between an older male and a younger one, usually a teenager. In Patroclus and Achilles' case, Achilles would have been the younger as Patroclus is usually seen as his elder. In Plato's ''Symposium'', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Sym.+180a 180a]; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at ''Iliad'' 2.673â€“674.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ancient Greek had no words to distinguish [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Dover]], ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship.

===&lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot; id=&quot;Fatalwound&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Death ===
[[File:Closeup of Achilles thniskon in Corfu Achilleion autocorrected.JPG|thumb|left|''Dying Achilles'' (Achilleas thniskon) in the gardens of the Achilleion]]

The death of Achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions.&lt;ref&gt;Abrantes 2016: c. 4.3.1&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the oldest account, In book 22 of the ''Iliad'', [[Hector]] predicts with his last dying breath that [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Apollo]] will slay him at the Scaean Gates leading to Troy (with an arrow to the heel according to Statius). In book 23, the sad spirit of dead Patroclus visits Achilles just as he drifts off into slumber, requesting that his bones be placed with those of Achilles in his golden vase, a gift of his mother.

In book 11 of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and Odysseus tells him of Neoptolemus' actions.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 11.467â€“564.&lt;/ref&gt;

Book 24 of ''Odyssey'' gives dead King Agamemnon's ghostly account of Achilles' death: the bleached bones from Achilles' funeral [[pyre]] had been mixed with those of [[Patroclus]] and put into his mother's golden vase. Also, the bones of [[Antilochus of Pylos|Antilochus]], who had become closer to Achilles than any other following Patroclus' death, were separately enclosed. The customary funeral games of a hero were performed, and a massive tomb or [[mound]] was built on the [[Hellespont]] for approaching seagoers to celebrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Odyssey of Homer| author= Richmond Lattimore| publisher = Harper Perennial| year = 2007| isbn = 978-0-06-124418-6| location = New York| page = 347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achilles was represented in the ''Aethiopis'' as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]]. Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him. According to some accounts, he had married [[Medea]] in life, so that after both their deaths they were united in the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] of [[Hades]]&amp;nbsp;â€“ as Hera promised Thetis in [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' (3rd century BC).

=== Fate of Achilles' armour ===

[[File:Odysseus Ajax Louvre F340.jpg|thumb|left|Oinochoe, ''ca'' 520 BC, [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Odysseus]] fighting over the armour of Achilles]]
Achilles' armour was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax the Great|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who, after considering both men's presentations, decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena, who temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, he was so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles. When Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades (''Odyssey'' 11.543â€“566), Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus.

The armour they fought for was made by [[Hephaestus]] and thus much stronger and more beautiful than any armour a mortal could craft. Thetis had the gear made for Achilles because his first set was worn by [[Patroclus]] when he went to battle and taken by [[Hector]] when he killed Patroclus. The [[Shield of Achilles]] was also made by the fire god. His legendary spear was given to him by his mentor [[Chiron]] before he participated in the [[Trojan War]]. It was called the Pelian Spear, which allegedly no other man could wield.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear; however, it was shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear.&quot; Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'', 1973, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, &quot;The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece&quot;, ''Yale French Studies'' '''59''': ''Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing'' (1980:65â€“85, especially 81).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achilles, Ajax and a game of ''petteia'' ===

Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] were playing a [[board game]] (''petteia'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html &quot;Petteia&quot;.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209122834/http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html |date=9 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html &quot;Greek Board Games&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408090534/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html |date=8 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html &quot;Latrunculi&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915044905/http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioannis Kakridis]] (1988).

The spread and intensity of the hero's veneration among the [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greeks]] that had [[Second Greek colonisation|settled]] on the northern coast of the [[Pontus Euxinus]], today's Black Sea, appears to have been remarkable. An archaic cult is attested for the [[Miletus|Milesian]] colony of [[Olbia (Pontic)|Olbia]] as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea, today identified with [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] Ð—Ð¼Ñ–Ñ—Ð½Ð¸Ð¹, ''Zmiinyi'', near [[Kiliya]], [[Ukraine]]). Early dedicatory inscriptions from the [[Greek colonies]] on the [[Black Sea]] ([[graffiti]] and inscribed clay disks, these possibly being [[votive offering]]s, from Olbia, the area of [[Berezan Island]] and the [[Tauric Chersonese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hildebrecht Hommel|title=Der Gott Achilleus|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften|issue=1|year=1980|pages=38â€“44}}&lt;/ref&gt;) attest the existence of a [[heroic cult]] of Achilles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. T. Hooker|title=The cults of Achilleus|journal=Rheinisches Museum fÃ¼r Philologie|volume=131|issue=3|date=1988|pages=1â€“7}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the sixth century BC onwards. The cult was still thriving in the third century CE, when dedicatory [[stelae]] from Olbia refer to an ''Achilles PontÃ¡rchÄ“s'' (Î Î¿Î½Ï„Î¬ÏÏ‡Î·Ï‚, roughly &quot;lord of the Sea,&quot; or &quot;of the [[Pontus Euxinus]]&quot;), who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia, venerated on par with [[Olympian gods]] such as the local [[Apollo]] Prostates, [[Hermes]] Agoraeus,&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; or [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref&gt;Quintus Smyrnaeus, 3.770â€“779.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] (23â€“79 AD) in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' mentions a &quot;port of the AchÃ¦i&quot; and an &quot;island of Achilles&quot;, famous for the tomb of that &quot;man&quot; ({{lang|la|portus Achaeorum, insula Achillis, tumulo eius viri clara}}), situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]]; furthermore, at 125&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s from this island, he places a peninsula &quot;which stretches forth in the shape of a sword&quot; obliquely, called ''Dromos Achilleos'' (á¼ˆÏ‡Î¹Î»Î»Î­Ï‰Ï‚ Î´ÏÏŒÎ¼Î¿Ï‚, ''AchillÃ©Ås drÃ³mos'' &quot;[[Racecourse of Achilles|the Race-course of Achilles]]&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.12.83 ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D26#note-link10 chapter 4.26]).&lt;/ref&gt; and considered the place of the hero's exercise or of games instituted by him.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; This last feature of Pliny's account is considered to be the iconic [[Spit (landform)|spit]], called today ''Tendra'' (or ''Kosa Tendra'' and ''Kosa Djarilgatch''), situated between the mouth of the [[Dnieper]] and [[Karkinit Bay]], but which is hardly 125&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s ({{c.|185}}&amp;nbsp;km) away from the [[Dnieper-Bug estuary]], as Pliny states. (To the &quot;Race-course&quot; he gives a length of 80&amp;nbsp;miles, {{c.|120|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the spit measures {{c.|70|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;km today.)

In the following chapter of his book, Pliny refers to the same island as ''Achillea'' and introduces two further names for it: ''Leuce'' or ''Macaron'' (from Greek [Î½á¿†ÏƒÎ¿Ï‚] Î¼Î±ÎºÎ±Ïá¿¶Î½ &quot;island of the blest&quot;). The &quot;present day&quot; measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of ''Achillea'' or ''Leuce'' with today's [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.13.93 ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D27 chapter 4.27]): &quot;Researches which have been made at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles from the Borysthenes, of 120 from [[Tyras]], and of fifty from the island of [[Peuce Island|Peuce]]. It is about ten miles in circumference.&quot; Though afterwards he speaks again of &quot;the remaining islands in the Gulf of [[Kerkinitis|Carcinites]]&quot; which are &quot;Cephalonesos, Rhosphodusa [or Spodusa], and Macra&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's contemporary [[Pomponius Mela]] ({{circa|43 AD|lk=no}}) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named ''Achillea'', situated between the [[Borysthenes]] and the [[Danube|Ister]], adding to the geographical confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Pomponius Mela, ''De situ orbis'' 2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly ({{Lang-ru|ÐšÑ€Ð¸Ñ‚ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹, ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð°Ð¹ Ð”Ð¼Ð¸Ñ‚Ñ€Ð¸ÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ‡}}) in 1823 on [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]]. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC [[Black-glazed Ware|black-glazed]] [[lekythos]] inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: &quot;Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke.&quot; In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt;

The heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on ''Leuce'' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic ''[[Aethiopis]]'' according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical {{lang|el|Î›ÎµÏÎºÎ· Îá¿†ÏƒÎ¿Ï‚}} (''LeÃºkÄ“ NÃªsos'' &quot;White Island&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ''Chrestomathia'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Already in the fifth century BC, [[Pindar]] had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a &quot;bright island&quot; (Ï†Î±ÎµÎ½Î½Î¬ Î½á¾¶ÏƒÎ¿Ï‚, ''phaennÃ¡ nÃ¢sos'') of the Black Sea,&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.49ff.; Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt; while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite [[Island of the Blest]] together with other heroes such as his father [[Peleus]] and [[Cadmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Olympia'' 2.78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Well known is the connection of these mythological [[Fortunate Isles]] (Î¼Î±ÎºÎ±Ïá¿¶Î½ Î½á¿†ÏƒÎ¿Î¹, ''makÃ¡rÃ´n nÃªsoi'') or the Homeric [[Elysium]] with the stream [[Oceanus]] which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], speaking of &quot;Achilles lord of Scythia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D. Page, ''Lyrica Graeca Selecta'', Oxford 1968, p. 89, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles' fight against the [[Aethiopia]]n prince [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother [[Eos]] after his death.

The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' ({{circa|130 AD|lk=no}}) gives the following details:

{{blockquote|It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus' honour, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honour Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles' temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles' honour. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles' oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn't run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;DensuÅŸianu&quot;/&gt;}}

The Greek geographer [[Dionysius Periegetes]], who likely lived during the first century CE, wrote that the island was called ''Leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Periegetes, ''Orbis descriptio'' 5.541, quoted in DensuÅŸianu 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, others relate the island's name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21; Scholion to Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles' temple and his statue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the [[Delphi]]c [[Pythia]] sent a lord of [[Crotone|Croton]] to be cured of a chest wound.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strabo]] mentioned that the cape of the Racecourse of Achilles was sacred to Achilles and although it was treeless, was called Alsos (á¼„Î»ÏƒÎ¿Ï‚).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:7.3.19 Strabo, Geography, 7.3.19]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alsos'' in Greek means &quot;[[Grove (nature)|grove]]&quot;.

A number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Strabo]] reported on the existence of a town ''AchÃ­lleion'' (á¼ˆÏ‡Î¯Î»Î»ÎµÎ¹Î¿Î½), built by settlers from [[Mytilene]] in the sixth century BC, close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the [[Troad]].&lt;ref name=Troad/&gt; Later attestations point to an ''AchÃ­lleion'' in [[Messenia]] (according to [[Stephanus Byzantinus]]) and an ''AchÃ­lleios'' (á¼ˆÏ‡Î¯Î»Î»ÎµÎ¹Î¿Ï‚) in [[Laconia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.25.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolae DensuÅŸianu]] recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of [[Aquileia]] and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called [[Chilia Veche|Chilia]] (presumably from an older ''Achileii''), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;DensuÅŸianu&quot;&gt;Nicolae DensuÅŸianu: ''Dacia preistoricÄƒ''. Bucharest: Carol GÃ¶bl, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, [[Neoptolemus]]. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], ''Pro Archia Poeta'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 216 the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception during antiquity ==
=== In Greek tragedy ===
{{main|Achilleis (trilogy)}}
The [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''Symposium'', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote ''The Lovers of Achilles'', a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radt. ''Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta'', vol. 4, (GÃ¶ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1977) frr. 149â€“157a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; [[Euripides]] refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'', and ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;&gt;Latacz 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Greek philosophy ===
====Zeno====
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centred one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;[[Epithets in Homer#Individuals|swift-footed]]&quot; [[Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

====Plato====
In ''[[Hippias Minor]]'', a [[Socratic dialogue]] attributed to [[Plato]], an arrogant man named Hippias argues with [[Socrates]]. The two get into a discussion about lying. They decide that a person who is intentionally false must be &quot;better&quot; than a person who is unintentionally false, on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jowett |first1=Benjamin |author2=Plato |title=Lesser Hippias |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1673/1673-h/1673-h.htm |publisher=Project Gutenberg |date=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates uses various analogies, discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point. The two also reference Homer extensively. Socrates and Hippias agree that [[Odysseus]], who concocted a number of lies throughout the ''Odyssey'' and other stories in the Trojan War Cycle, was false intentionally. Achilles, like Odysseus, told numerous falsehoods. Hippias believes that Achilles was a generally honest man, while Socrates believes that Achilles lied for his own benefit. The two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident. Socrates eventually abandons Homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point: someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally.

=== In Roman and medieval literature ===
The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;/&gt; [[Virgil]] refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 2.28, 1.30, 3.87.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Horace]] portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 4.6.17â€“20.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers, such as [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Ovid]], represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as [[Dictys Cretensis]] and [[Dares Phrygius]] and in [[BenoÃ®t de Sainte-Maure]]'s {{Lang|fr|[[Roman de Troie]]}} and [[Guido delle Colonne]]'s ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]'', which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the [[Matter of Troy]] until the 17th century.

Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler [[Leo the Deacon]], not as [[Hellenes|Hellene]], but as [[Scythians|Scythian]], while according to the Byzantine author [[John Malalas]], his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as [[Bulgars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekonomou|first1=Andrew|title=Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes|date=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=UK|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zomZk6DbFTIC&amp;q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles&amp;pg=PA123|access-date=14 September 2015|isbn=9780739119778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Croke|first2=Brian|title=Studies in John Malalas|location=Australian Association for Byzantine Studies, Department of Modern Greek, University of Sydney|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p55mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles|access-date=14 September 2015|isbn=9780959362657|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abraham Lincoln''' ({{IPAc-en|Ëˆ|l|Éª|Å‹|k|É™n}} {{Respell|LING|kÉ™n}}; February 12, 1809&amp;nbsp;â€“ April 15, 1865) was an American lawyer, politician, and statesman who served as the 16th [[president of the United States]] from 1861 until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination]] in 1865. Lincoln led the United States through the [[American Civil War]], defending the nation as a constitutional [[Union (American Civil War)|union]], defeating the insurgent [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], playing a major role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of]] [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], expanding the power of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and modernizing the [[U.S. economy]].

Lincoln was born into poverty in a [[log cabin]] in [[Kentucky]] and was raised on the [[American frontier|frontier]], mainly in [[Indiana]]. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and [[U.S. representative]] [[List of United States representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. In 1854, angered by the [[Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act]], which opened the territories to slavery, he re-entered politics. He soon became a leader of the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He reached a national audience in the [[Lincolnâ€“Douglas debates|1858 Senate campaign debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas|Stephen A. Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for [[1860 United States presidential election|president in 1860]], sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the [[Southern United States|South]] viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began [[Secession in the United States|seceding from the nation]]. During this time, the newly formed [[Confederate States of America]] began seizing federal military bases in the South. A little over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attacked Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union.

Lincoln, a [[Moderate Republicans (Reconstruction era)|moderate Republican]], had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican parties. His allies, the [[War Democrat]]s and the [[Radical Republicans]], demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. Anti-war Democrats (called &quot;[[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]&quot;) despised Lincoln, and some irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements went so far as to plot his assassination. His [[Gettysburg Address]] came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in [[Ex parte Merryman|Maryland]] and [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|elsewhere]], and he averted war with Britain by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. In 1863, he issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which declared the slaves in the states &quot;in rebellion&quot; to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to &quot;recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons&quot; and to receive them &quot;into the armed service of the United States.&quot; Lincoln pressured [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which abolished slavery, except as punishment for a crime.

Lincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just five days after the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Confederate surrender at Appomattox]], he was attending a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington, D.C., with his wife, [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]], when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln is remembered as a [[martyr]] and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. Lincoln is often [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Scholar survey summary|ranked]] in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.

==Family and childhood==
===Early life===
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], in a log cabin on [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park|Sinking Spring Farm]] near [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=20â€“22}} He was a descendant of [[Samuel Lincoln]], an Englishman who migrated from [[Hingham, Norfolk]], to its namesake, [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], in 1638. The family then migrated west, passing through [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=3â€“4}} Lincoln was also a descendant of the [[Harrison family of Virginia]]; his paternal grandfather and namesake, [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Captain Abraham Lincoln]] and wife Bathsheba (nÃ©e Herring) moved the family from Virginia to [[Jefferson County, Kentucky]].{{efn|The identity of Lincoln's grandmother Bathsheba Herring, though without certainty, is the consensus of multiple Lincoln biographers. She was the daughter of Alexander and Abigail Herring (nÃ©e Harrison).{{sfn|Harrison|1935|p=276}}}} The captain was killed in an [[Northwest Indian War|Indian raid]] in 1786.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=4}} His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham's father, witnessed the attack.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=21}}{{efn|Thomas, born January 1778, would have been 8 at the attack, May 1786. Older sources use six.{{sfn|Wilson|Davis|Wilson|Herndon|1998|pp=35â€“36}}}} Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and [[Tennessee]] before the family settled in [[Hardin County, Kentucky]], in the early 1800s.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=21}}

[[File:Log Cabin at the Lincoln Living Historical Farm.jpg|thumb|The farm site where Lincoln grew up in [[Spencer County, Indiana]]]]

Lincoln's mother [[Nancy Lincoln]] is widely assumed to be the daughter of Lucy Hanks.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=79}} Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=9}} They had three children: [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]], Abraham, and Thomas, who died as an infant.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=9â€“10}}

Thomas Lincoln bought or leased farms in Kentucky before losing all but {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of his land in court disputes over [[Title (property)|property titles]].{{sfn|Sandburg|1926|p=20}} In 1816, the family moved to [[Indiana]], where the land surveys and titles were more reliable.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=13}} They settled in an &quot;unbroken forest&quot;{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=26}} in Hurricane Township, [[History of Perry County, Indiana|Perry County, Indiana]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=16, 43}} When the Lincolns moved to Indiana it &quot;had just been admitted to the Union&quot; as a [[Slave states and free states|&quot;free&quot; (non-slaveholding)]] state,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burlingame|Burlingame, Michael]], [https://www.knox.edu/documents/LincolnStudies/BurlingameVol1Chap2.pdf ''Abraham Lincoln: A Life'', vol. 1, p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; except that, though &quot;no new enslaved people were allowed, ... currently enslaved individuals remained so&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/underground-railroad-indiana/ &quot;The Underground Railroad in Indiana&quot;, ''National Geographic'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Their land eventually became part of Space, when the county was established in 1818.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=3, 5, 16}}}} In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot;, but mainly due to land title difficulties.{{sfnm|Sandburg|1926|1p=20|Donald|1996|2pp=23â€“24}}

In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=34, 156}} At various times he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. Thomas and Nancy were members of a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=22â€“24}}

Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas in 1827 obtained [[clear title]] to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} in Indiana, an area which became known as [[Little Pigeon Creek Community]].{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=24, 104}}

===Mother's death===
On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died from [[milk sickness]], leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of a household including her father, nine-year-old Abraham, and Nancy's 19-year-old orphan cousin, Dennis Hanks.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=22â€“23, 77}} Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son, devastating Lincoln.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=34, 116}}

On December 2, 1819, Thomas married [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]], a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=23, 83}} Abraham became close to his stepmother and called her &quot;Mother&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=26â€“27}} Dennis Hanks said he was lazy, for all his &quot;readingâ€”scribblingâ€”writingâ€”cipheringâ€”writing poetry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Blumenthal|Blumenthal, Sidney]], ''A Self-Made Man: The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln, 1809-1849''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2016, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; His stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy &quot;physical labor&quot; but loved to read.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=66}}{{sfn|White|2009|p=30}}

===Education and move to Illinois===
Lincoln was largely self-educated.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=10, 33}} His formal schooling was from [[itinerant teacher]]s. It included two short stints in Kentucky, where he learned to read, but probably not to write. At age seven,{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=23}} and in Indiana, due to  farm chores, he attended school only sporadically, for a total of fewer than 12 months in aggregate by age 15.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p= 29}} Nonetheless, he remained an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.{{sfn|Madison|2014|p=110}} Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his readings included the [[King James Version|King James Bible]], [[Aesop's Fables]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]''.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=29â€“31, 38â€“43}} Despite being self-educated, Lincoln was the recipient of [[honorary degree]]s later in life, including an honorary [[Doctor of Law]]s from [[Columbia University]] in June 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Columbia University Libraries Online Exhibitions {{!}} Jewels in Her Crown: Treasures of Columbia University Libraries Special Collections |url=https://exhibitions.library.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/jewels/themes/new_york/45 |access-date=August 7, 2023 |website=exhibitions.library.columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teen, Lincoln's &quot;father grew more and more to depend on him for the 'farming, grubbing, hoeing, making fences' necessary to keep the family afloat. He also regularly hired his son out to work ... and by law, he was entitled to everything the boy earned until he came of age&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=32}} Lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic, and became adept at using an ax.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=134â€“135}} He was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough [[Catch wrestling|catch-as-catch-can]] style (also known as catch wrestling).

Speculation persists that Lincoln's first romantic interest was [[Ann Rutledge]], whom he met when he moved to New Salem. However, witness testimony, given decades afterward, showed a lack of any specific recollection of a romance between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine | last=Gannett | first=Lewis | date=Winter 2005 | title='Overwhelming Evidence' of a Lincoln-Ann Rutledge Romance?: Reexamining Rutledge Family Reminiscences | url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext | magazine=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association | location=Springfield, IL | publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association | pages=28â€“41 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403014805/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext | archive-date=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rutledge died on August 25, 1835, most likely of [[typhoid fever]]; Lincoln took the death very hard saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on Ann's grave.

In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=56â€“57, 69â€“70}} Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem.

On August 16, 1837, he wrote Owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship, and she never replied.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=67}}

In 1839, Lincoln met [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]], and the following year they became engaged.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=80â€“86}} She was the daughter of [[Robert Smith Todd]], a wealthy lawyer and businessman in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Lamb|Swain|2008|p=3}} Their wedding, which was set for January 1, 1841, was canceled because Lincoln did not appear, but they reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield home of Mary's sister.{{sfn|Sandburg|1926|pp=260,290â€“291}} While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, he was asked where he was going and replied, &quot;To hell, I suppose&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=93}} In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near his law office.

Lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons, though his work regularly kept him away from home. The eldest, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], was born in 1843, and was the only child to live to maturity. [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie), born in 1846, died February 1, 1850, probably of tuberculosis. Lincoln's third son, [[William Wallace Lincoln|&quot;Willie&quot; Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever at the [[White House]] on February 20, 1862. The youngest, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853, and survived his father, but died of heart failure at age 18 on July 16, 1871.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=179â€“181, 476}}{{efn|The Lincolns' last descendant, great-grandson [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emerson, Jason |title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T.

Lincoln &quot;was remarkably fond of children&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|p=126}} and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own.{{sfn|Baker|1989|p=120}} In fact, Lincoln's law partner [[William H.

==Early career and militia service==
{{Further|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War}}
During 1831 and 1832, Lincoln worked at a general store in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem, Illinois]]. In 1832, he declared his candidacy for the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the [[Illinois Militia]] during the [[Black Hawk War]].{{sfn|Winkle|2001|pp=86â€“95}} When Lincoln returned home from the [[Black Hawk War]], he planned to become a blacksmith, but instead formed a partnership with 21-year-old William Berry, with whom he purchased a New Salem general store on credit. Because a license was required to sell customers beverages, Berry obtained bartending licenses for $7 each for Lincoln and himself, and in 1833 the [[Lincoln-Berry General Store]] became a tavern as well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} 

As licensed bartenders, Lincoln and Berry were able to sell spirits, including liquor, for 12 cents a pint. They offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food, including takeout dinners. But Berry became an alcoholic, was often too drunk to work, and Lincoln ended up running the store by himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Blazeski |first=Goran |date=October 15, 2016 |title=Abraham Lincoln was the only President who was also a licensed bartender |url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/10/15/abraham-lincoln-was-the-only-president-who-was-also-a-licensed-bartender/?chrome=1&amp;A1c=1 |access-date=March 4, 2022 |website=The Vintage News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the economy was booming, the business struggled and went into debt, causing Lincoln to sell his share.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

In his first campaign speech after returning from his military service, Lincoln observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his &quot;neck and the seat of his trousers&quot;, and tossed him.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=36}} In the campaign, Lincoln advocated for navigational improvements on the [[Sangamon River]].

True to his record, Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be &quot;an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=222}} Their party favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund [[internal improvements]] including railroads, and urbanization.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=137â€“153}}

In 1843, Lincoln sought the Whig nomination for [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|Illinois's 7th district seat]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]; he was defeated by [[John J.

=== Political views ===
On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke against the [[Mexicanâ€“American War]], which he imputed President [[James K.

Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his [[Spot Resolutions]].

Lincoln argued in an 1858 criminal trial, defending William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=150â€“151}} The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness.

The debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the [[Compromise of 1850]], a legislative package designed to address the issue.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=175â€“176}} In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to &quot;both extremes&quot; on the slavery issue.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=182â€“185}} As the slavery debate in the [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] and [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed [[Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result, but Douglas's [[Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act]] narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=188â€“190}}

Lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his &quot;[[Abraham Lincoln's Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]&quot; of October 1854. Lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=148â€“152}} He said the Kansas Act had a &quot;''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world....&quot;{{sfn|Graebner|1959|p=255}} Lincoln's attacks on the Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203â€“205}}

Nationally the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting on the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, &quot;I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist. ... I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|pp=215â€“216}} The new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery, drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party and combining [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty]], and antislavery [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] members,{{sfn|McGovern|2009|pp=38â€“39}} Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203â€“204}} Lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist [[Know Nothing]] movement.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=191â€“194}}

In 1854, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature but declined to take his seat. The year's elections showed the strong opposition to the Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act, and in the aftermath, Lincoln sought election to the United States Senate.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203â€“205}} At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=119}} After leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]]. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=205â€“208}}

==== 1856 campaign ====
[[Bleeding Kansas|Violent political confrontations in Kansas]] continued, and opposition to the Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the [[United States elections, 1856|1856 elections]] approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the [[Bloomington Convention]], which formally established the [[Illinois Republican Party]]. The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the [[Lincoln's Lost Speech|final speech]] of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=216â€“221}} At the June [[1856 Republican National Convention]], though Lincoln received support to run as vice president, [[John C. FrÃ©mont]] and [[William Dayton]] were on the ticket, which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State [[James Buchanan]] and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=224â€“228}} Buchanan prevailed, while Republican [[William Henry Bissell]] won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=229â€“230}}{{efn|[[Eric Foner]] contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast, who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans, who thought it was bad because it hurt [[white people]] and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism principles]] of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|Foner|2010|pp=84â€“88}}}}

==== ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' ====
[[Dred Scott]] was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the [[Missouri Compromise]]. After Scott was returned to the slave state, he petitioned a federal court for his freedom. His petition was denied in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857).{{Efn|Although the name of the Supreme Court case is ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'', the respondent's [[surname]] was actually &quot;Sanford&quot;. A [[court clerk|clerk]] misspelled the name, and the court never corrected the error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Vishneski|first=John| year=1988| title=What the Court Decided in Dred Scott v.

Taney]] wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution, and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners' &quot;property&quot; rights. While many Democrats hoped that ''Dred Scott'' would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=236â€“238}} Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].{{sfn|Zarefsky|1993|pp=69â€“110}} He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal &quot;in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;.{{sfn|Jaffa|2000|pp=299â€“300}}

===Lincolnâ€“Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===
{{Further|Lincolnâ€“Douglas debates|Cooper Union speech}}

In 1858, Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S. Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him. Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247â€“248}} Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas for his opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]] and admission of Kansas as a [[slave state]].{{sfn|Oates|1974|pp=138â€“139}} Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247â€“250}}
[[File:Lincoln O-17 by Brady, 1860.png|thumb|left|''Abraham Lincoln'', a portrait by [[Mathew Brady]] taken February 27, 1860, the day of Lincoln's [[Cooper Union speech]] in New York City]]

Lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal. After his nomination he delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], with the biblical reference [[Mark 3#A house divided|Mark 3:25]], &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolvedâ€”I do not expect the house to fallâ€”but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|p=251}} The speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion.{{sfn|Harris|2007|p=98}} The stage was then set for the election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=209}} When informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, &quot;[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party&amp;nbsp;... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|pp=257â€“258}}

The Senate campaign featured seven [[Lincolnâ€“Douglas debates|debates]] between Lincoln and Douglas. These were the most famous political debates in American history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=214â€“218}} The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that the [[Slave Power]] was threatening the values of republicanism, and he accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers' premise that [[all men are created equal]]. In his [[Freeport Doctrine]], Douglas argued that, despite the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]] decision, which he claimed to support,{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=202, 219, 232}} local settlers, under the doctrine of [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]], should be free to choose whether to allow slavery within their territory, and he accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=214â€“224}} Lincoln's argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed that Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery. Douglas's argument was more legal in nature, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court as exercised in the ''Dred Scott'' decision.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=223}}

Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. However, Lincoln's articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=89â€“90}} In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger'', a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted for Democrats, but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=242, 412}} In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by [[William H. Seward]], [[Salmon P. Chase]], [[Edward Bates]], and [[Simon Cameron]]. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=291â€“293}} In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and, in the following months, several local papers endorsed his candidacy.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=307â€“308}}

Over the coming months Lincoln was tireless, making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail. By the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric, he quickly became the champion of the Republican party. However, despite his overwhelming support in the [[Midwestern United States]], he was less appreciated in the east. [[Horace Greeley]], editor of the New York Tribune, at that time wrote up an unflattering account of Lincoln's compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court's ''Dred Scott'' ruling, which was promptly used against him by his political rivals.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=200}}{{sfn|Morse|1893|p=112}}

On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]], in which he argued that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. He insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong&quot;.{{sfn|Jaffa|2000|p=473}} Many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly.{{sfn|Holzer|2004|pp=108â€“111}} But Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership, which brought him into contention. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience&quot;.{{sfnm|Carwardine|2003|1p=97|Holzer|2004|2p=157}}

Historian [[David Herbert Donald]] described the speech as &quot;a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant. Appearing in Seward's home state, sponsored by a group largely loyal to Chase, Lincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these Republican rivals for the nomination.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=240}} In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, &quot;The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=241}}

On May 9â€“10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=244}} Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], [[Norman B.

On May 18 at the [[1860 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, was nominated for vice president to [[Ticket balance|balance the ticket]]. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff.{{sfn|Luthin|1944|pp=609â€“629}} Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support.{{sfn|Hofstadter|1938|pp=50â€“55}} Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to &quot;Make no contracts that will bind me&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=247â€“250}}

As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=10, 13, 18}} When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the [[1860 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]]; they opposed Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] as their candidate.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=253}} A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] and nominated [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247â€“248}}

Before the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the [[Wide Awakes]], which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lincoln for President: An Unlikely Candidate, An Audacious Strategy, and the Victory No One Saw Coming|last=Chadwick|first=Bruce|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=2PQqZzyw4uAC|page=l49}}|pages=147â€“149|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, Illinois|date=2009|access-date=April 1, 2017|isbn=978-1-4022-4756-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;Murrin, John (2006).

As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of &quot;free labor&quot;, which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=254â€“256}} The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life and sold 100,000â€“200,000 copies.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=254}} Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired [[John George Nicolay]] as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=251â€“252|p=}}

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states, an omen of the impending Civil War.{{sfn|Mansch|2005|p=61}}{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=256}} Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon.{{sfn|White|2009|p=350}} His victory in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|p=4:312}}

The South was outraged by Lincoln's election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861.{{sfn|Edgar|1998|p=350}} On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=267|Potter|1977|p2=498}} Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the [[Confederate States of America]], and adopted a constitution.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=267}} The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal.{{sfn|White|2009|p=362}} President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.{{sfn|Potter|1977|pp=520, 569â€“570}} The Confederacy selected [[Jefferson Davis]] as its provisional president on February 9, 1861.{{sfn|White|2009|p=369}}

Attempts at compromise followed but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed [[Crittenden Compromise]] as contrary to the Party's platform of free-soil in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=360â€“361}} Lincoln said, &quot;I will suffer death before I consent&amp;nbsp;... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=268}}

Lincoln supported the [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which passed Congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when Lincoln took office.

[[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Robert Anderson]], commander of the Union's [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston, South Carolina, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops [[Battle of Fort Sumter|at Fort Sumter]] and began the fight. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and overlooking [[Southern Unionist]] opposition to an invasion.{{sfn|Nevins|1959|p=5:29}}

[[William Tecumseh Sherman]] talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at his failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and that the South was preparing for war.{{sfn|Sherman|1990|pp=185â€“186}} Donald concludes, &quot;His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Fort Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he had also vowed not to surrender the forts.... The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the Confederates to fire the first shot&quot;. They did just that.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=293}}

On April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send a total of [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|75,000 volunteer troops]] to recapture forts, protect Washington, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states. This call forced states to choose sides. Virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] as the Confederate capital, despite its exposure to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas followed over the following two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky remained neutral.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=226}} The Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to defend the nation.

As states sent Union regiments south, on April 19 Baltimore mobs in control of the rail links [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] who were changing trains. Local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the Army responded by arresting [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|local Maryland]] officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|habeas corpus]]'' in an effort to protect the troops trying to reach Washington.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|Coles|2002|p=174}} [[John Merryman]], one Maryland official hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus.'' In June, in [[Ex parte Merryman]], Taney, not ruling on behalf of the Supreme Court,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One significant point of disagreement among historians and political scientists is whether Roger Taney heard ''Ex parte Merryman'' as a U.S. circuit judge or as a Supreme Court justice in chambers.&quot; White, Jonathan W., ''Abraham Lincoln and Treason in the Civil War: The Trials of John Merryman'', Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2011, pp. 38â€“39.&lt;/ref&gt; issued the writ, believing that Article I, section 9 of the Constitution authorized only Congress and not the president to suspend it. But Lincoln invoked [[nonacquiescence]] and persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=59â€“71}}{{sfn|Neely|1992|pp=3â€“31}}

====Union military strategy====
Lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] military strategy. He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as [[commander-in-chief]] by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln gained the support of Congress and the northern public for these actions. Lincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=303â€“304|Carwardine|2003|2pp=163â€“164}}

Seward|William Seward]], [[Gideon Welles]], Lincoln, and others]]

It was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success, and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. The Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=315â€“339, 417}} On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]], which authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates. The law had little practical effect, but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=314|Carwardine|2003|2p=178}}

In August 1861, General John C. FrÃ©mont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, without consulting Washington, issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels. Lincoln canceled the proclamation as violating the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]] and beyond FrÃ©mont's authority to issue.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=314â€“317}} As a result, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|p=181}}

Internationally, Lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the Confederacy.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=213â€“214}} He relied on his combative Secretary of State [[William Seward]] while working closely with [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] chairman [[Charles Sumner]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=322}} In the 1861 [[Trent Affair]], which threatened war with Great Britain, the U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the ''Trent'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer [[James G. Randall]] dissected Lincoln's successful techniques:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James Garfield|last= Randall|title=Lincoln the President: Springfield to Gettysburg|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=Vi8aAQAAIAAJ|page=50}}|year=1946|page=50|isbn=978-0-306-80754-1}} quoted in Peraino, Kevin (2013) ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power''. pp. 160â€“61. {{ISBN|978-0-307-88720-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of State Department's attitude toward Britain, his deference toward Seward and Sumner, his withholding of his paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing Congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America's true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.}}

Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the War Department. He tracked all phases of the effort, consulting with governors and selecting generals based on their success, their state, and their party. In January 1862, after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]] Simon Cameron with [[Edwin Stanton]]. Stanton centralized the War Department's activities, auditing and canceling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=115}} Stanton was a staunch Unionist, pro-business, conservative Democrat who gravitated toward the Radical Republican faction. He worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than did any other senior official. &quot;Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together&quot;, say Thomas and Hyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WTGTAAAAIAAJ|page=385}}|title=Stanton: The Life and Times of Lincoln's Secretary of War|last1=Thomas|first1=Benjamin Platt|last2=Hyman|first2=Harold Melvin|date=1962|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pages= 71, 87, 229â€“30, 385 (quote)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's war strategy had two priorities: ensuring that Washington was well-defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt, decisive victory.{{efn|Major Northern newspapers, however, demanded moreâ€”they expected victory within 90 days.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=295â€“296}}}} Twice a week, Lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon. Occasionally Mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=391â€“392}} For his edification Lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff General [[Henry Halleck]] entitled ''Elements of Military Art and Science''; Halleck was a disciple of the European strategist [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]]. Lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfn|Ambrose|1996|pp=7, 66, 159}} Lincoln saw the importance of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than merely capturing territory.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=432â€“436}}

In directing the Union's war strategy, Lincoln valued the advice of [[Winfield Scott|Gen. Winfield Scott]], even after his retirement as [[Commanding General of the United States Army]]. On June 23â€“24, 1862, Lincoln made an unannounced visit to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], where he spent five hours consulting with Scott regarding the handling of the Civil War and the staffing of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=102390793/ |title=The President at West Point |date=June 26, 1862 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=May 23, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220523163528/https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=102390793/|archive-date=May 23, 2022|url-status=live |location=New York |page=8 |via=Newspapers.com |quote=the President and Gen.

====General McClellan====
After the Union rout at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]] and [[Winfield Scott]]'s retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General [[George B. McClellan]] general-in-chief.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=318â€“319}} McClellan then took months to plan his Virginia [[Peninsula Campaign]]. McClellan's slow progress frustrated Lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. McClellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on Lincoln's reservation of troops for the capital.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=349â€“352}}

The image on the right shows Lincoln and [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]] on October 3, 1862.}}

In 1862, Lincoln removed McClellan for the general's continued inaction. He elevated Henry Halleck in July and appointed [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/henry-w-halleck|title=Henry W. Halleck|date=June 15, 2011|website=American Battlefield Trust|access-date=October 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008062810/https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/henry-w-halleck|archive-date=October 8, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope satisfied Lincoln's desire to advance on Richmond from the north, thereby protecting Washington from counterattack.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|pp=159â€“162}} But in the summer of 1862 Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], forcing the Army of the Potomac back to defend Washington.{{sfn|Nevins|1959|pp=159â€“162}}

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|pp=478â€“479}} Two days after McClellan's return to command, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|pp=478â€“480}} That battle, a Union victory, was among the bloodiest in American history; it facilitated Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|p=481}}

McClellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue Lee's withdrawing army, while General [[Don Carlos Buell]] likewise refused orders to move the [[Army of the Ohio]] against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and after the [[1862 and 1863 United States House of Representatives elections|1862 midterm elections]] he replaced McClellan with [[Ambrose Burnside]]. The appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on Lincoln's part.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=389â€“390}}

Against presidential advice Burnside launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was [[Battle of Fredericksburg|defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg]] in December. Desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after Fredericksburg, so Lincoln replaced Burnside with [[Joseph Hooker]].{{sfnm|Nevins|1947|1pp=433â€“444|Donald|1996|2pp=429â€“431}}

In the 1862 midterm elections, the Republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of ''habeas corpus'', [[Conscription|military draft law]], and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest, but cost votes in the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest, where many Southerners had lived for generations.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|p=322}}

In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near; the plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=422â€“423}}

Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May, then resigned and was replaced by [[George Meade]].{{sfn|Nevins|1947|pp=432â€“450}} Meade followed Lee north into Pennsylvania and beat him in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln's demands. At the same time, Grant captured Vicksburg and gained control of the Mississippi River, splitting the far western rebel states.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=444â€“447}}

The Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states. Lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented, because these territories would be admitted to the Union as free states, and free states would come to outnumber slave states. He sought to persuade the states to agree to [[compensated emancipation|compensation]] for emancipating their slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |title=The Liberator |first=Thomas Owens |last=Mackubin |author-link=Mackubin Thomas Owens |date=March 25, 2004 |work=National Review |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216125903/http://old.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |archive-date=February 16, 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln rejected Major General [[John C. FrÃ©mont]]'s August 1861 [[FrÃ©mont Emancipation|emancipation]] attempt, as well as one by Major General [[David Hunter]] in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede.{{sfn|Guelzo|1999|pp=290â€“291}}

In June 1862, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory, which Lincoln signed. In July, the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] was enacted, providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion; Lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional. He felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander-in-chief, which he planned to exercise. On July 22, 1862, Lincoln reviewed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=364â€“365}}

Peace Democrats (Copperheads) argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification, but Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', in his public letter, &quot;The Prayer of Twenty Millions&quot;, implored Lincoln to embrace emancipation.{{sfn|McPherson|1992|p=124}}&lt;ref&gt;Lundberg, James M. (2019). ''Horace Greeley: Print, Politics, and the Failure of American Nationhood'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; In a public letter of August 22, 1862, Lincoln replied to Greeley, writing that while he personally wished all men could be free, his first obligation as president was to preserve the Union:{{sfn|Guelzo|2004|pp=147â€“153}}

{{Blockquote|My paramount object in this struggle ''is'' to save the Union, and is ''not'' either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing ''any'' slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing ''all'' the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do ''not'' believe it would help to save the Union&amp;nbsp;... [Â¶] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of ''official'' duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed ''personal'' wish that all men everywhere could be free.{{sfn|Graebner|1959|p=388}}}}

When Lincoln published his reply to Greeley, he had already decided to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and therefore had already chosen the third option he mentioned in his letter to Greeley: to free some of the slaves, namely those in the states in rebellion. Some scholars, therefore, believe that his reply to Greeley was disingenuous and was intended to reassure white people who would have opposed a war for emancipation that emancipation was merely a means to preserve the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Henry.

He spent the next 100 days, between September 22 and January 1, preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P.

By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Tennessee military governor [[Andrew Johnson]] encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, &quot;The bare sight of fifty thousand armed, and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=431}} By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] &quot;had enrolled twenty regiments of African Americans&quot; from the Mississippi Valley.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=431}}

Lincoln spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=453â€“460}} In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot;. He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that the future of democracy would be assured, and that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=460â€“466|Wills|2012|2pp=20, 27, 105, 146}}

Defying his prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here&quot;, the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=222}}

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

[[Ulysses S. Grant|General Ulysses Grant's]] victories at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and in the [[Vicksburg campaign]] impressed Lincoln. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;{{sfn|Thomas|2008|p=315}} With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could advance in multiple theaters, while also including black troops. Meade's failure to capture Lee's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander. Grant then assumed command of Meade's army.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|pp=4:6â€“17}}

Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864. He arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant's political intentions, and once assured that he had none, Lincoln promoted Grant to the newly revived rank of Lieutenant General, a rank which had been unoccupied since [[George Washington]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=490â€“492}} Authorization for such a promotion &quot;with the advice and consent of the Senate&quot; was provided by a new bill which Lincoln signed the same day he submitted Grant's name to the Senate. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on March 2, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/grant|title=Message of President Abraham Lincoln Nominating Ulysses S. Grant to Be Lieutenant General of the Army|date=August 15, 2016|website=National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant in 1864 waged the bloody [[Overland Campaign]], which exacted heavy losses on both sides.{{sfn|McPherson|2009|p=113}} When Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, the persistent general replied, &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=501}} Grant's army moved steadily south. Lincoln traveled to Grant's headquarters at [[City Point, Virginia]], to confer with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |title=The Peacemakers |publisher=The White House Historical Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927000627/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |access-date=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln reacted to Union losses by mobilizing support throughout the North.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=422â€“424}} Lincoln authorized Grant to target infrastructureâ€”plantations, railroads, and bridgesâ€”hoping to weaken the South's morale and fighting ability. He emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies over destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake.{{sfn|Neely|2004|pp=434â€“458}} Lincoln's engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when Confederate general [[Jubal Early]] [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raided Washington, D.C.]] Legend has it that while Lincoln watched from an exposed position, Union Captain (and future [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Justice]]) [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot; But this story is commonly regarded as apocryphal.&lt;ref&gt;[[James M. McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]''. (New York, 1988) 757.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James G. Randall]] and [[Richard N.

Edward White]], ''Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: Law and the Inner Self''. New York, 1993, 64â€“65.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Grant continued to weaken Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens|Stephens]] led a group meeting with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads Conference|Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to negotiate with the Confederacy as a coequal; his objective to end the fighting was not realized.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=565}} On April 1, 1865, Grant nearly encircled Petersburg in a siege. The Confederate government evacuated Richmond and Lincoln visited the conquered capital. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]], officially ending the war.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=589}}

===Reelection===

[[File:Republican presidential ticket 1864b.jpg|thumb|A poster of the 1864 election campaign with [[Andrew Johnson]] as the candidate for vice president]]

Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864, while uniting the main Republican factions along with [[War Democrats]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] and Andrew Johnson. Lincoln used conversation and his patronage powersâ€”greatly expanded from peacetimeâ€”to build support and fend off the Radicals' efforts to replace him.{{sfnm|Fish|1902|1pp=53â€“69|Tegeder|1948|2pp=77â€“90}} At its convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=494â€“507}}

Grant's bloody stalemates damaged Lincoln's re-election prospects, and many Republicans feared defeat. Lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House;{{sfn|Grimsley|Simpson|2001|p=80}} Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope. The pledge read as follows:{{blockquote|text=This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7/1:1124?rgn=div1;view=fulltext|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln. Volume 7|orig-date=1953|page=514|chapter=Memorandum Concerning His Probable Failure of Re-election|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Democratic platform followed the &quot;Peace wing&quot; of the party and called the war a &quot;failure&quot;; but their candidate, McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Meanwhile, Lincoln emboldened Grant with more troops and Republican party support. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and [[David Farragut]]'s capture of Mobile ended defeatism.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=531}} The Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. The National Union Party was united by Lincoln's support for emancipation. State Republican parties stressed the [[perfidy]] of the Copperheads.{{sfn|Randall|Current|1955|p=307}} On November 8, Lincoln carried all but three states, including 78 percent of Union soldiers.{{sfnm|1a1=Grimsley|1a2=Simpson|1y=2001|1p=80|2a1=Paludan|2y=1994|2pp=274â€“293}}

[[File:Abraham Lincoln second inaugural address.jpg|thumb|alt=A large crowd in front of a large building with many pillars|Lincoln's [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]] at the almost completed Capitol building, March 4, 1865]]
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[second inaugural address]]. In it, he deemed the war casualties to be God's will. Historian [[Mark Noll]] places the speech &quot;among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world;&quot; it is inscribed in the [[Lincoln Memorial]].{{sfn|Noll|2002|p=426}} Lincoln said:

{{Blockquote|Fondly do we hopeâ€”fervently do we prayâ€”that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the [[wikt:bondman|bond-man's]] two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether&quot;. With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphanâ€”to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8/1:711.1?hi=0;rgn=div2;singlegenre=All;size=25;sort=occur;start=1;subview=detail;type=simple;view=fulltext;q1=fondly|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln.

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction era}}
Reconstruction preceded the war's end, as Lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be treated, Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=509â€“512}} Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. His main goal was to keep the union together, so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forged in Crisis: The Making of Five Legendary Leaders|last=Koehn|first=Nancy|publisher=Scribner|year=2017|isbn=978-1-5011-7444-5|location=NY|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies. Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners, if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=471â€“472}}

[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union''. The caption reads (Johnson): &quot;Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.&quot; (Lincoln): &quot;A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.&quot;]]

As Southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations were restored. In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln respectively appointed Johnson and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed, and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery. Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the 1864 [[Wadeâ€“Davis Bill]], which Lincoln vetoed. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=485â€“486}}

Lincoln's appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the Radicals' choice, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|p=4:206}}

After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. He declared that such an amendment would &quot;clinch the whole matter&quot; and by December 1863 an amendment was brought to Congress.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=561}} The Senate passed it on April 8, 1864, but the first vote in the House of Representatives fell short of the required two-thirds majority. Passage became part of Lincoln's reelection platform, and after his successful reelection, the second attempt in the House passed on January 31, 1865.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=562â€“563}} With ratification, it became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Primary Documents in American History: 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html |publisher=Library of Congress |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010110013/http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html |archive-date=October 10, 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed Senator Charles Sumner's [[Freedmen's Bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. The law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=242â€“243}}

Historians agree that it is impossible to predict how Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived. Biographers James G. Randall and [[Richard Current]], according to David Lincove, argue that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lincove|first=David A.|title=Reconstruction in the United States: An Annotated Bibliography|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=3EQcT7-Dpi0C|page=80}}|year= 2000|publisher=Greenwood|page=80|isbn=978-0-313-29199-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.}}

[[Eric Foner]] argues that:{{sfn|Foner|2010|p=335}}
{{Blockquote|Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans.&amp;nbsp;... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves&amp;nbsp;... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.}}

===Native Americans===
Lincoln's relationship with Native Americans started before he was born, with their killing of his grandfather in front of his sons, including Lincoln's father Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/LegislativeMoments/moments08RS/01_web_leg_moments.htm#:~:text=In+referring+to+his+grandfather,upon+my+mind+and+memory.%E2%80%9D|title=Lincoln Lore â€“ Abraham Lincoln's Grandfather|website=apps.legislature.ky.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln himself served as a captain in the [[Illinois National Guard|state militia]] during the [[Black Hawk War]] but saw no combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article-View/Article/573923/captain-abraham-lincoln-of-the-illinois-militia|title=Captain Abraham Lincoln of the Illinois militia|website=National Guard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln used appointments to the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Bureau]] as a reward to supporters from [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]]. While in office his administration faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from Indian attacks.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|pp=3,4}}

On August 17, 1862, the [[Dakota War of 1862|Dakota War]] broke out in Minnesota. Hundreds of settlers were killed, 30,000 were displaced from their homes, and Washington was deeply alarmed.{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=480}} Some feared incorrectly that it might represent a Confederate conspiracy to start a war on the Northwestern frontier.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|pp=4â€“5,7}} Lincoln ordered thousands of Confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the uprising.{{sfnm|Burlingame|2008|1p=481|Nichols|1974|2p=7}} When the Confederates protested forcing Confederate prisoners to fight Indians, Lincoln revoked the policy and none arrived in Minnesota.

Some he released due to the efforts of Bishop [[Henry Whipple]].

===Whig theory of a presidency===
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to Congress' responsibility for legislating. Under this philosophy, Lincoln vetoed only four bills during his presidency, including the [[Wade-Davis Bill]] with its harsh Reconstruction program.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=137}} The [[1862 Homestead Act]] made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost. The 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] provided government grants for [[List of agricultural universities and colleges|agricultural colleges]] in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[first transcontinental railroad]], which was completed in 1869.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|p=116}} The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.{{sfn|McPherson|2009|pp=450â€“452}}

In the selection and use of his cabinet Lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency. Lincoln commented on his thought process, &quot;We need the strongest men of the party in the Cabinet. We needed to hold our own people together. I had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their services.&quot;{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|p=319}} Goodwin described the group in her biography as a ''[[Team of Rivals]]''.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005}}

There were two measures passed to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a [[Income tax in the United States|Federal income tax]]. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]]s, following the first enacted by Buchanan. He also signed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]], creating the first U.S. income taxâ€”a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ({{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=0|fmt=eq}}{{Inflation/fn|US}}).{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=424}} The [[Revenue Act of 1862]] adopted rates that increased with income.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|p=111}}

The Lincoln Administration presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in other areas. The [[National Banking Act]] created the system of national banks. The U.S. issued paper currency for the first time, known as [[Greenback (1860s money)|greenbacks]]â€”printed in green on the reverse side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brands |first=H.

In response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the ''[[New York World]]'' and the ''[[The Journal of Commerce|Journal of Commerce]]'' published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market. Lincoln attacked the media for such behavior, and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=501â€“502}}

{{Wikisource|Thanksgiving Proclamation (1863)}}

Lincoln is largely responsible for the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=471}} Thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in New England in the 17th century. It had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. The prior proclamation had been during [[James Madison]]'s presidency 50 years earlier. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=471}}

In June 1864 Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaffer|first=Jeffrey P.|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|publisher=Wilderness Press|page=48|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=978-0-89997-244-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's philosophy on court nominations was that &quot;we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=471}} Lincoln made five appointments to the Supreme Court. [[Noah Haynes Swayne]] was an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. [[Samuel Freeman Miller]] supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis was Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced. Democrat [[Stephen Johnson Field]], a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, became Chief Justice. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.{{sfn|Blue|1987|p=245}}

===Foreign policy===
{{Main|Presidency of Abraham Lincoln#Foreign policy|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}
Lincoln named his main political rival, William H. Seward, as Secretary of State and left most diplomatic issues in Seward's portfolio. However, Lincoln did select some top diplomats as part of his patronage policy.&lt;ref&gt;Neill F. Sanders, &quot;'When A House Is on Fire': The English Consulates and Lincoln's Patronage Policy.&quot; ''Lincoln Herald'' (1981), 83#4, pp. 579â€“59.&lt;/ref&gt; He also closely watched the handling of the [[Trent Affair]] in late 1861 to make sure the situation did not escalate into war with Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Peraino, ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power'' (2014), pp. 138â€“169.&lt;/ref&gt; Seward's main role was to keep Britain and France from supporting the Confederacy. He was successful after indicating to Britain and France that the Union would declare war on them if they supported the South.&lt;ref&gt;Peraino, ''Lincoln in the World'', pp. 3â€“16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination==

[[John Wilkes Booth]] was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=586â€“587}} After attending Lincoln's last public address, on April 11, 1865, in which Lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some black men, specifically &quot;on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/last.htm|title=Abraham Lincoln's Last Public Address|website=www.abrahamlincolnonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President.{{sfn|Harrison|2010|pp=3â€“4}} When Booth learned of the Lincolns' intent to attend a play with General Grant, he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at [[Ford's Theatre]]. Lincoln and his wife attended the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on the evening of April 14, just five days after the Union victory at the [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse]]. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=594â€“597}}

At 10:15 in the evening Booth entered the back of Lincoln's theater box, crept up from behind, and fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. Lincoln's guest, Major [[Henry Rathbone]], momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=597|Martin|2010}} After being attended by [[Charles Leale|Doctor Charles Leale]] and two other doctors, Lincoln was taken across the street to [[Petersen House]].

Two weeks later, Booth, refusing to surrender, was tracked to a farm in Virginia. He was mortally shot by Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] and died on April 26.

As a young man Lincoln was a [[religious skepticism|religious skeptic]].{{sfnm|Carwardine|2003|1p=4|Wilson|1999|2p=84}} He was deeply familiar with the [[Bible]], quoting and praising it.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=48â€“49, 514â€“515}} He was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln1/1:403?rgn=div1;view=fulltext|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln.

In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the [[The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated|Doctrine of Necessity]], a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=48â€“49}} With the death of his son Edward in 1850 he more frequently expressed a dependence on God.{{sfn|Parrillo|2000|pp=227â€“253}} He never joined a church, although he frequently attended [[First Presbyterian Church (Springfield, Illinois)|First Presbyterian Church]] with his wife beginning in 1852.{{sfn|White|2009|p=180}}{{efn|On claims that Lincoln was baptized by an associate of [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], see {{cite journal|url=http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_38_no_2_contents/martin.html |last=Martin |first=Jim |title=The secret baptism of Abraham Lincoln |journal=Restoration Quarterly |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1996 |access-date=May 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019204330/http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_38_no_2_contents/martin.html |archive-date=October 19, 2012 }}}}

In the 1850s Lincoln asserted his belief in &quot;providence&quot; in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; instead, he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=g9EynQEACAAJ}}|title=&quot;Our Country&quot;: Northern Evangelicals and the Union During the Civil War and Reconstruction|last=Brodrecht|first=Grant R.|date=2008|publisher=University of Notre Dame}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|pp=251â€“254}} After Willie's death, he questioned the divine necessity of the war's severity.

=== Republican values ===
Lincoln's redefinition of ''[[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]'' has been stressed by historians such as [[John Patrick Diggins]], [[Harry V. Jaffa]], [[Vernon Burton]], Eric Foner, and Herman J. Belz.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|p=61}} Lincoln called the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]â€”which emphasized freedom and equality for allâ€”the &quot;[[sheet anchor]]&quot; of republicanism beginning in the 1850s. He did this at a time when the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], which &quot;tolerated slavery&quot;, was the focus of most political discourse.{{sfnm|Jaffa|2000|1p=399|Thomas|2008|2p=61}} Diggins notes, &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself&quot; in the 1860 Cooper Union speech.{{sfnm|Diggins|1986|1p=307|Thomas|2008|2p=61}} Instead of focusing on the legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism.{{sfnm|Foner|2010|1p=215|Thomas|2008|2p=61}}

His position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the Constitution as essentially a contract among the states, and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract. Furthermore, it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state.{{sfnm|Jaffa|2000|1p=263|Thomas|2008|2p=61}} Many soldiers and religious leaders from the north, though, felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=_zaSs2HzEEwC|page=243}}|title=The Age of Lincoln: A History|last=Burton|first=Orville Vernon|date=2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4299-3955-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Whig activist Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to [[Jacksonian democrats]].{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=196â€“198, 229â€“231, 301}} Lincoln shared the sympathies that the Jacksonians professed for the common man, but he disagreed with the Jacksonian view that [[Laissez-faire|the government should be divorced from economic enterprise]].{{sfn|Current|1999}} Nevertheless, Lincoln admired [[Andrew Jackson]]'s steeliness as well as his patriotism.{{sfn|Wilentz|2012}} According to historian [[Sean Wilentz]]:{{sfn|Wilentz|2012}}

{{blockquote|Just as the Republican Party of the 1850s absorbed certain elements of Jacksonianism, so Lincoln, whose Whiggery had always been more egalitarian than that of other Whigs, found himself absorbing some of them as well. And some of the Jacksonian spirit resided inside the Lincoln White House.}}

[[William C. Harris (historian)|William C. Harris]] found that Lincoln's &quot;reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism.&quot;{{sfn|Harris|2007|p=2}} James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation &quot;in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform.&quot; Randall concludes that &quot;he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.&quot;{{sfn|Randall|1962|p=175}}

===Reunification of the states===

In Lincoln's first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and he explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints. He said, &quot;A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.&quot;{{sfn|Belz|1998|p=86}}

The successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country. The term &quot;the United States&quot; has historically been used sometimes in the plural (&quot;these United States&quot;) and other times in the singular. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Burt |first=Andrew |date=May 13, 2013 |title='These United States': How Obama's Vocal Tic Reveals a Polarized America |magazine=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/these-united-states-how-obamas-vocal-tic-reveals-a-polarized-america/275739/ |access-date=February 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's assassination left him a national martyr. He was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.{{sfn|Chesebrough|1994|pp=76, 79, 106, 110}} Historians have said he was &quot;a [[classical liberal]]&quot; in the 19th-century sense. [[Allen C. Guelzo]] states that Lincoln was a &quot;classical liberal democratâ€”an enemy of artificial hierarchy, a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling, and an American counterpart to [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], and [[John Bright|Bright]]&quot;, whose portrait Lincoln hung in his White House office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Joseph R.|last1=Fornieri|first2=Sara Vaughn|last2=Gabbard|title=Lincoln's America: 1809â€“1865|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=Xarqzbuf43sC|page=19}}|year=2008|publisher=[[SIU Press]]|location=Carbondale, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8093-8713-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Randall|1962|pp=65â€“87}}

Sociologist [[Barry Schwartz (sociologist)|Barry Schwartz]] argues that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the [[Progressive Era]] (1900â€“1920s), when he emerged as one of America's most venerated heroes, even among white Southerners. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Schwartz|2000|p=109}}

Union nationalism, as envisioned by Lincoln, &quot;helped lead America to the nationalism of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].&quot;{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|p=222}} In the [[New Deal]] era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the [[self-made man]] or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the [[welfare state]].{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=23, 91â€“98}}

Schwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with &quot;a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life.&quot; During the [[Great Depression]], he argues, Lincoln served &quot;as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful.&quot; Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, &quot;What would Lincoln do?&quot;{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=xi, 9, 24}} However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this &quot;fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness.&quot; He suggested that [[postmodernism]] and [[multiculturalism]] have diluted greatness as a concept.{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=xi, 9}}

In the [[Cold War]] years Lincoln's image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by [[Communist regime]]s.{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=23, 91â€“98}} He had long been known as the Great Emancipator,&lt;ref&gt;The origin of the nickname is unknown.

'''Aristotle'''{{Efn-ua|{{IPAc-en|Ëˆ|Ã¦r|áµ»|s|ËŒ|t|É’|t|É™l}} {{respell|ARR|iss|tot|É™l}}{{sfn|Collins English Dictionary}}}} ({{lang-grc-gre|á¼ˆÏÎ¹ÏƒÏ„Î¿Ï„Î­Î»Î·Ï‚}} ''AristotÃ©lÄ“s'', {{IPA-grc|aristotÃ©lÉ›Ës|pron}}; 384â€“322&amp;nbsp;BC) was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] and [[polymath]]. His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the [[natural science]]s, [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]], [[psychology]], and [[the arts]]. As the founder of the [[Peripatetic school]] of philosophy in the [[Lyceum (classical)|Lyceum]] in [[Athens]], he began the wider [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern [[science]].

Little is known about Aristotle's life. He was born in the city of [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]] in [[northern Greece]] during the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]]. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At 17 or 18, he joined [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in Athens and remained there until the age of 37 ({{circa| 347 BC}}). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip II of Macedon]], tutored his son [[Alexander the Great]] beginning in 343 BC. He established a library in the Lyceum, which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on [[papyrus]] [[scrolls]].

Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around [[Works of Aristotle|a third of his original output has survived]], none of it intended for publication. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. His teachings and methods of inquiry have had a significant impact across the world, and remain a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.

Aristotle's views profoundly shaped [[History of science#Middle Ages|medieval scholarship]]. The influence of [[Aristotelian physics|his physical science]] extended from [[late antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and was not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]] were developed. He influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800â€“1400)|Judeo-Islamic philosophies]] during the Middle Ages, as well as [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]].

Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as &quot;The First Teacher&quot;, and among medieval Christians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] as simply &quot;The Philosopher&quot;, while the poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] called him &quot;the master of those who know&quot;. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, [[Aristotelian ethics|his ethics]], although always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]].

== Life ==

In general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.{{efn-ua | See {{harvnb|Shields|2012|pp=3â€“16}}; {{harvnb|DÃ¼ring|1957}} covers ancient biographies of Aristotle.}}

Aristotle was born in 384&amp;nbsp;BC{{efn-ua|That these dates (the first half of the Olympiad year 384/383 BC, and in 322 shortly before the death of Demosthenes) are correct was shown by [[August Boeckh]] (''Kleine Schriften'' VI 195); for further discussion, see [[Felix Jacoby]] on ''[[FGrHist]]'' 244 F 38. Ingemar DÃ¼ring, ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'', GÃ¶teborg, 1957, {{p.|253}}}} in [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]], [[Chalcidice]],{{sfn|Aristotle (Greek philosopher)}} about 55&amp;nbsp;km (34 miles) east of modern-day [[Thessaloniki]].{{sfn|McLeisch|1999|p=5}}{{sfn|Aristoteles-Park in Stagira}} His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of Macedon]]. While he was young, Aristotle learned about biology and medical information, which was taught by his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Borchers|first1=Timothy A. |title=Rhetorical Theory: An Introduction |publisher=Waveland Press, Inc. |date=2018|first2=Heather |last2=Hundley|isbn=978-1-4786-3580-2|edition=Second |location=Long Grove, Illinois|oclc=1031145493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of Aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen, and [[Proxenus of Atarneus]] became his guardian.{{sfn|Hall|2018|p=14}} Although little information about Aristotle's childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)#Kingship and the royal court|Macedonian monarchy]].{{sfn|Anagnostopoulos|2013|page=4}}

[[File:20160518 092 mieza nympheum.jpg|thumb|left|School of Aristotle in [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia, Greece]]. ]]

At the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]].{{sfn|Blits|1999|pp=58â€“63}} He probably experienced the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, &quot;to experience is to learn&quot; [Ï€Î±Î¸ÎµÎ¯Î½ Î¼Î±Î¸ÎµÄ©Î½].{{sfn|Evans|2006}} Aristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348/47&amp;nbsp;BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew [[Speusippus]], although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died.{{sfn|Aristotle|1984|pp=Introduction}} Aristotle then accompanied [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married [[Pythias]], either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. They had a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].{{sfn|Shields|2016}}{{sfn|Russell|1972}}

[[File:Aristotle_tutoring_Alexander.jpg|thumb|upright|&quot;Aristotle tutoring Alexander&quot; by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]]. ]]

Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal Academy of [[Macedon]]. During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]].{{sfn|Green|1991|pp=58â€“59}} Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotle's own attitude towards [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] was unabashedly [[Ethnocentricism|ethnocentric]]. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be &quot;a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants&quot;.{{sfn|Green|1991|pp=58â€“59}} By 335&amp;nbsp;BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum (classical)|Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stagira. They had a son whom Aristotle named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. If the ''[[Suda]]'' {{En dash}} an uncritical compilation from the Middle Ages {{En dash}} is accurate, he may also have had an ''[[eromenos|erÃ´menos]]'', [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus of Abydus]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=88}}

[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg| thumb | upright | [[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] (1st or 2nd century AD) copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]].]]

This period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.{{sfn|Russell|1972}} He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[On the Soul]]'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to &quot;logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance, and theatre.&quot;{{sfn|Humphreys|2009}}

Near the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence of this is an [[Hagnothemis|unlikely claim]] made some six years after the death.{{sfn|Green|1991|p=460}} Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322&amp;nbsp;BC, Demophilus and [[Eurymedon the Hierophant]] reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety,{{sfn|Filonik|2013|pp=72â€“73}} prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in [[Chalcis|Chalcis, on Euboea]], at which occasion he was said to have stated: &quot;I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy&quot;{{sfn|Jones|1980|p=216}}{{sfn|Gigon|2017|p=41}}{{sfn|DÃ¼ring|1957|p=T44a-e}} â€“ a reference to Athens's [[Trial of Socrates|trial and execution of Socrates]].

== Theoretical philosophy ==
=== Logic ===
{{Main|Term logic}}
{{further | Non-Aristotelian logic}}

With the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic,{{sfn| Degnan | 1994 | pp=81â€“89}} and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in [[mathematical logic]].{{sfn| Corcoran | 2009 | pp=1â€“20}} [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] stated in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that with Aristotle, logic reached its completion.{{sfn| Kant | 1787 | pages=Preface}}

==== ''Organon'' ====
{{Main|Organon}}
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg| thumb | upright | [[Plato]] (left) and Aristotle in [[Raphael]]'s 1509 fresco, ''[[The School of Athens]]''. Aristotle holds his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and gestures to the earth, representing his view in immanent realism, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, indicating his Theory of Forms, and holds his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.{{sfn| School of Athens}}{{sfn|Stewart|2019}}]]
Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the ''[[Organon]]'' around 40 BC by [[Andronicus of Rhodes]] or others among his followers.{{sfn| Pickover | 2009 | page=52}} The books are:
# ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]''
# ''[[On Interpretation]]''
# ''[[Prior Analytics]]''
# ''[[Posterior Analytics]]''
# ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]''
# ''[[On Sophistical Refutations]]''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''Analytics''){{sfn| Prior Analytics | pp= 24b18â€“20}}{{sfn| Bobzien | 2015}} and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. The ''Rhetoric'' is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the ''Topics''.{{sfn| Smith | 2017}}

What is today called ''Aristotelian logic'' with its [[Syllogism#Types|types of syllogism]] (methods of logical argument),{{sfn| Lagerlund | 2016}} Aristotle himself would have labelled &quot;analytics&quot;. The term &quot;logic&quot; he reserved to mean ''dialectics''.

=== Metaphysics ===
{{Main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}
The word &quot;metaphysics&quot; appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name ''Metaphysics''.{{sfn| Cohen | 2000}} Aristotle called it &quot;first philosophy&quot;, and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (''theoretikÄ“'') philosophy which is &quot;theological&quot; and studies the divine. He wrote in his ''Metaphysics'' (1026a16):

{{blockquote | if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones, the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge; but if there is some motionless independent thing, the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy, and it is universal ''in just this way'', because it is first. And it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being, both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1999 | page=111}}}}

==== Substance ====
{{further | Hylomorphism }}

Aristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] (''ousia'') and [[essence]] (''to ti Ãªn einai'', &quot;the what it was to be&quot;) in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called [[hylomorphism]]. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers, etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=VIII 1043a 10â€“30}}{{sfn| Cohen | 2000}}

===== Immanent realism =====
{{Main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}
[[File:Platonic and Aristotelian Forms.svg| thumb | upright=1.5 | [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of forms|forms]] exist as [[universals]], like the ideal form of an apple. For Aristotle, both matter and form belong to the individual thing ([[hylomorphism]]).]]
Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Problem of universals|universal]]. Aristotle's [[ontology]] places the universal (''katholou'') in [[particular]]s (''kath' hekaston''), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. For Aristotle, &quot;form&quot; is still what [[phenomena]] are based on, but is &quot;instantiated&quot; in a particular substance.{{sfn| Cohen | 2000}}

Plato argued that all things have a [[Theory of forms|universal form]], which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When one looks at an apple, for example, one sees an apple, and one can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, one can place an apple next to a book, so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the forms as existing separately from the things that participate in them, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.{{sfn| Cohen | 2000}}{{sfn|Lloyd|1968|pages=43â€“47}}

===== Potentiality and actuality =====
Concerning the nature of change (''[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes, as he outlines in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[On Generation and Corruption]] (''319bâ€“320a), he distinguishes coming-to-be (''genesis'', also translated as 'generation') from:

# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;
# locomotion, which is change in space; and
# alteration, which is change in quality.

[[File:Flute-player dolphin Alcesti Group MAN.jpg| thumb | Aristotle argued that a capability like playing the flute could be acquired â€“ [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|the potential made actual]] â€“ by learning.]]

Coming-to-be is a change where the substrate of the thing that has undergone the change has itself changed. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') a plant, and if it is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially, beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate â€“ being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise â€“ acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and potentiality exists for the sake of the end, actuality, accordingly, is the end. Referring then to the previous example, it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.{{sfn| Cohen | 2000}}

{{blockquote | For that for the sake of which (''to hou heneka'') a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=IX 1050a 5â€“10}}}}

In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, &quot;what is it that makes a man one&quot;? Since, according to [[Plato]] there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.{{sfn| Cohen | 2000}}{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=VIII 1045aâ€“b}}

=== Epistemology ===
Aristotle's immanent realism means his [[epistemology]] is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.{{sfn|Smith|2017}} Aristotle uses [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from examples alongside [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], whereas Plato relies on deduction from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.{{sfn|Smith|2017}}

== Natural philosophy ==
Aristotle's &quot;natural philosophy&quot; spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}} In Aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. However, his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;scientific method&quot;. For Aristotle, &quot;all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.{{sfn|Wildberg|2016}}

=== Physics ===

{{Main|Aristotelian physics}}

==== Five elements ====
{{Main|Classical element}}

In his ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by [[Empedocles]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme added the heavenly [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], the divine substance of the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]], stars and planets.{{sfn|Lloyd|1968|pages=133â€“139, 166â€“169}}

==== Motion ====
{{further | History of classical mechanics}}

Aristotle describes two kinds of motion: &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;unnatural motion&quot;, such as that of a thrown stone, in the ''Physics'' (254b10), and &quot;natural motion&quot;, such as of a falling object, in ''On the Heavens'' (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also: in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest,{{sfn| Allain | 2016}}{{efn-ua | Rhett Allain notes that [[Newton's First Law]] is &quot;essentially a direct reply to Aristotle, that the natural state is ''not to change'' motion.{{sfn| Allain | 2016}}}} since Aristotle does not address [[friction]].{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60â€“84}} With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}{{efn-ua | Leonard Susskind comments that Aristotle had clearly never gone [[ice skating]] or he would have seen that it takes force to stop an object.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}}} This would imply the equation{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}

:: &lt;math&gt;F=mv&lt;/math&gt;,

incorrect in modern physics.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}

Natural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens,{{efn-ua | For heavenly bodies like the Sun, Moon, and stars, the observed motions are &quot;to a very good approximation&quot; circular around the Earth's centre, (for example, the apparent rotation of the sky because of the rotation of the Earth, and the rotation of the moon around the Earth) as Aristotle stated.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23â€“40}}}} while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23â€“40}}{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60â€“84}}{{efn-ua | Drabkin quotes numerous passages from ''Physics'' and ''On the Heavens'' (''De Caelo'') which state Aristotle's laws of motion.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60â€“84}}}}

[[File:Aristotle's laws of motion.svg| thumb | upright=1.5 | Aristotle's laws of motion. In ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' he states that objects fall at a speed proportional to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid they are immersed in.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60â€“84}} This is a correct approximation for objects in Earth's gravitational field moving in air or water.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23â€“40}}]]

In the ''Physics'' (215a25), Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law, that the speed, v, of a falling body is proportional (say, with constant c) to its weight, W, and inversely proportional to the density,{{efn-ua | Drabkin agrees that density is treated quantitatively in this passage, but without a sharp definition of density as weight per unit volume.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60â€“84}}}} Ï, of the fluid in which it is falling:;{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23â€“40}}{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60â€“84}}

:: &lt;math&gt;v=c\frac{W}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

Aristotle implies that in a [[vacuum]] the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23â€“40}}{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60â€“84}} Opinions have varied on whether Aristotle intended to state quantitative laws. Henri Carteron held the &quot;extreme view&quot;{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60â€“84}} that Aristotle's concept of force was basically qualitative,{{sfn| Carteron | 1923 | pages=1â€“32 and passim}} but other authors reject this.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60â€“84}}

[[Archimedes]] corrected Aristotle's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they [[Archimedes' principle|displace enough water]]; floating depends in Archimedes' scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not, as Aristotle thought, its elementary composition.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23â€“40}}

Aristotle's writings on motion remained influential until the [[Early Modern]] period. [[John Philoponus]] (in [[Late antiquity]]) and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (in [[Early modern period]]) are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}} A contrary opinion is given by [[Carlo Rovelli]], who argues that Aristotle's physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the [[Earth]]'s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23â€“40}}), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}{{efn-ua | Philoponus and Galileo correctly objected that for the transient phase (still increasing in speed) with heavy objects falling a short distance, the law does not apply: Galileo used balls on a short incline to show this. Rovelli notes that &quot;Two heavy balls with the same shape and different weight do fall at different speeds from an aeroplane, confirming Aristotle's theory, not Galileo's.&quot;{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23â€“40}}}}

Newton's &quot;forced&quot; motion corresponds to Aristotle's &quot;violent&quot; motion with its external agent, but Aristotle's assumption that the agent's effect stops immediately it stops acting (e.g., the ball leaves the thrower's hand) has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the Medieval [[theory of impetus]].{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23â€“40}}

==== Four causes ====
{{Main|Four causes}}
[[File:Aristotle's Four Causes of a Table.svg| thumb | upright=1.5 | Aristotle argued by analogy with woodwork that a thing takes its form from [[four causes]]: in the case of a table, the wood used ([[material cause]]), its design ([[formal cause]]), the tools and techniques used ([[efficient cause]]), and its decorative or practical purpose ([[final cause]]).{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=88â€“90}}]]

Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors. His term ''aitia'' is traditionally translated as &quot;cause&quot;, but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as &quot;explanation&quot;, but the traditional rendering will be employed here.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96â€“100, 106â€“107}}{{sfn| Hankinson | 1998 | page=159}}
* [[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood. It is not about action. It does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96â€“100, 106â€“107}}
* The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells one what a thing is, that a thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96â€“100, 106â€“107}}
* The [[efficient cause]] is &quot;the primary source&quot;, or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, non-living or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. In the case of two dominoes, when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96â€“100, 106â€“107}} In the case of animals, this agency is a combination of [[developmental biology|how it develops from the egg]], and [[physiology|how its body functions]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=91â€“92, 369â€“373}}
* The [[final cause]] (''telos'') is its purpose, the reason why a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96â€“100, 106â€“107}} In the case of living things, it implies [[adaptation]] to a particular way of life.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=91â€“92, 369â€“373}}

==== Optics ====
{{further | History of optics}}

Aristotle describes experiments in [[optics]] using a [[camera obscura]] in ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]]'', book 15. The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small [[aperture]] that let light in. With it, he saw that whatever shape he made the hole, the sun's image always remained circular. He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image.{{sfn| Lahanas}}

==== Chance and spontaneity ====
{{further | Accident (philosophy)}}

According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental things]], &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot;. There is also more a specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that only applies to people's moral choices.{{sfn| Physics | p=2.6}}{{sfn| Miller | 1973 | pp=204â€“213}}

=== Astronomy ===
{{further | History of astronomy}}

In [[astronomy]], Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of &quot;those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,&quot; pointing out partly correctly that if &quot;the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.&quot;{{sfn| Meteorology | p=1. 8}} He also wrote descriptions of comets, including the [[Great Comet of 371 BC]].{{sfn| Meteorology}}

=== Geology and natural sciences ===
{{further | History of geology}}
[[File:Aerial image of Stromboli (view from the northeast).jpg| thumb | Aristotle noted that the ground level of the [[Aeolian islands]] changed before a [[volcanic eruption]].]]
Aristotle was one of the first people to record any [[geology|geological]] observations. He stated that [[Uniformitarianism|geological change]] was too slow to be observed in one person's lifetime.{{sfn| Moore | 1956 | page=13}}{{sfn| Meteorology | p=Book 1, Part 14}}
The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] noted that Aristotle described such change, including &quot;lakes that had dried up&quot; and &quot;deserts that had become watered by rivers&quot;, giving as examples the growth of the [[Nile delta]] since the time of [[Homer]], and &quot;the upheaving of one of the [[Aeolian islands]], previous to a [[volcanic eruption]].&quot;'{{sfn| Lyell | 1832 | page=17}}

''Meteorologica'' lends its name to the modern study of meteorology, but its modern usage diverges from the content of Aristotle's ancient treatise on [[meteors]]. The ancient Greeks did use the term for a range of atmospheric phenomena, but also for [[earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. Aristotle proposed that the cause of earthquakes was a gas or vapor (''anathymiaseis'') that was trapped inside the earth and trying to escape, following other Greek authors [[Anaxagoras]], [[Empedocles]] and [[Democritus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Udias |first1=Agustin |last2=Buforn |first2=Elisa |title=Principles of Seismology |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle. For example, he made some of the earliest observations about desalination: he observed early â€“ and correctly â€“ that when seawater is heated, freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff (&quot;I have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle|translator-last=Lee|translator-first=H.D.P.|title=Meteorologica, Chapter II |year=1952 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=156 |edition=Loeb Classical Library |url=http://archive.org/details/L397AristotleMeteorologica |access-date=22 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biology ===
{{Main|Aristotle's biology}}
[[File:Tremoctopus violaceus5.jpg| thumb | upright | Among many pioneering zoological observations, Aristotle described the reproductive [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] of the [[octopus]] (bottom left).]]

==== Empirical research ====
Aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically,{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=7}} and biology forms a large part of his writings. He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of [[Lesbos]] and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=14}}{{sfn| Thompson | 1910 | page=Prefatory Note}} His data in ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', ''[[Movement of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'' are assembled from his own observations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/darwins-ghosts-by-rebecca-stott-7808310.html|title=Darwin's Ghosts, By Rebecca Stott
|website=independent.co.uk|date=2 June 2012
|access-date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; statements given by people with specialized knowledge, such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=196, 248}} His apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident: his works on [[botany]] have been lost, but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived.{{sfn| Day | 2013 | pp=5805â€“5816}}

Aristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and the catches of fishermen. He describes the [[catfish]], [[electric ray]], and [[frogfish]] in detail, as well as [[cephalopod]]s such as the [[octopus]] and [[paper nautilus]]. His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=66â€“74, 137}} He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of [[ruminant]]s,{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=118â€“119}} and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=73}}

He notes that an animal's structure is well matched to function so birds like the [[heron]] (which live in marshes with soft mud and live by catching fish) have a long neck, long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas [[duck]]s that swim have short legs and webbed feet.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=135â€“136}} [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of [[evolution]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=206}} Aristotle's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridizations]] could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles's materialist theory of a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results.{{sfn| Sedley | 2007 | page=189}} To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a [[common descent|common ancestor]], or that one kind can [[speciation|change into another]], or that kinds can become [[extinction|extinct]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=273}}

==== Scientific style ====
[[File:Two of Aristotle's Growth Laws.svg| thumb | left | upright=1.4 | Aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals, including that [[brood size]] decreases with body mass, whereas [[gestation]] period increases. He was correct in these predictions, at least for mammals: data are shown for mouse and elephant.]]

Aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense.{{sfn| Taylor | 1922 | page=42}} He used the ancient Greek term ''pepeiramenoi'' to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=361â€“365}} In ''Generation of Animals'', he finds a fertilized hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside.{{sfn| Leroi | 2011}}{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=197â€“200}}

Instead, he practiced a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=365â€“368}}{{sfn| Taylor | 1922 | page=49}} This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as [[genomics]]. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, [[Aristotle's biology]] is scientific.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=365â€“368}}

From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of [[biological rules|rules]] relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. [[Life expectancy|Lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]], and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=408}}{{Clear}}

==== Classification of living things ====

{{further|Scala naturae}}

[[File:Scyliorhinus retifer embryo.JPG|thumb |Aristotle recorded that the [[embryo]] of [[Mustelus canis|&lt;!--a different species shown--&gt;a dogfish]] was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta (the [[yolk sac]]), like a higher animal; this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=72â€“74}}]]

Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of [[animal]]s,{{sfn|Bergstrom|Dugatkin|2012|page=35}}{{sfn|Rhodes|1974|page=7}} arranging these in the ''History of Animals'' in a graded scale of perfection, a nonreligious version of the ''[[scala naturae]]'', with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave [[viviparity|live birth]] to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above [[plant]]s, and these in turn were above minerals.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pages=201â€“202}}{{sfn|Lovejoy|1976}} He grouped what the modern zoologist would call [[vertebrate]]s as the hotter &quot;animals with blood&quot;, and below them the colder [[invertebrate]]s as &quot;animals without blood&quot;. Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing ([[mammal]]s), and the egg-laying ([[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]]). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled â€“ cephalopods, and [[crustacea|shelled]]) and the hard-shelled [[mollusc]]s ([[bivalve]]s and [[gastropod]]s). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a [[placenta]] like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle,&lt;!--Leroi |p= 113--&gt; is [[convergent evolution]].{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=111â€“119}} Philosophers of science have generally concluded that Aristotle was not interested in taxonomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lennox |first=James G. |title=Aristotle's Philosophy of Biology: Studies in the Origins of Life Science |date=2001 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-65976-0 |pages=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sandford |first1=Stella |title=From Aristotle to Contemporary Biological Classification: What Kind of Category is &quot;Sex&quot;? |journal=Redescriptions: Political Thought, Conceptual History and Feminist Theory |date=3 December 2019 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=4â€“17 |doi=10.33134/rds.314 |s2cid=210140121 |language=en |issn=2308-0914|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; but zoologists who studied this question in the early 21st century think otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Voultsiadou |first1=Eleni |last2=Vafidis |first2=Dimitris |title=Marine invertebrate diversity in Aristotle's zoology |journal=Contributions to Zoology |date=1 January 2007 |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=103â€“120 |doi=10.1163/18759866-07602004 |s2cid=55152069 |url=https://doi.org/10.1163/18759866-07602004 |language=en |issn=1875-9866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=von Lieven |first1=Alexander FÃ¼rst |last2=Humar |first2=Marcel |title=A Cladistic Analysis of Aristotle's Animal Groups in the &quot;Historia animalium&quot; |journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences |date=2008 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=227â€“262 |jstor=23334371 |pmid=19203017 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23334371 |issn=0391-9714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurin |first1=Michel |last2=Humar |first2=Marcel |title=Phylogenetic signal in characters from Aristotle's History of Animals |journal=Comptes Rendus Palevol |date=2022 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=1â€“16 |doi=10.5852/cr-palevol2022v21a1 |s2cid=245863171 |language=fr|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this [[teleological]] view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.{{sfn|Mason|1979|pp=43â€“44}}

=== Psychology ===
==== Soul ====
{{further | On the Soul}}
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png| thumb | upright=1.5 | Aristotle proposed a three-part [[Soul#Aristotle|structure for souls]] of plants, animals, and humans, making humans unique in having all three types of soul.]]

Aristotle's [[psychology]], given in his treatise ''[[On the Soul]]'' (''peri psychÄ“s''), posits three kinds of [[soul]] (&quot;psyches&quot;): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have all three. The vegetative soul is concerned with growth and nourishment. The sensitive soul experiences sensations and movement. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the ''[[Nous#Aristotle|nous]]'' (intellect) and ''logos'' (reason).{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=156â€“163}}

For Aristotle, the soul is the [[Hylomorphism#Bodyâ€“soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).{{sfn| Shields | 2016}} In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | p=45}} Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].{{sfn| Guthrie | 2010 | p=348}}

In ''On the Soul'', Aristotle famously criticizes Plato's theory of the soul and develops his own in response. The first criticism is against Plato's view of the soul in the ''Timaeus'' that the soul takes up space and is able to come into physical contact with bodies.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' I.3 406b26-407a10. For some scholarship, see Carter, Jason W. 2017. 'Aristotle's Criticism of Timaean Psychology' ''Rhizomata'' 5: 51â€“78 and Douglas R. Campbell. 2022. &quot;Located in Space: Plato's Theory of Psychic Motion&quot; ''Ancient Philosophy'' 42 (2): 419â€“442.&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century scholarship overwhelmingly opposed Aristotle's interpretation of Plato and maintained that he had misunderstood him.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, W.D. Ross argued that Aristotle &quot;may well be criticized as having taken [Plato's] myth as if it were sober prose.&quot; See Ross, William D. ed. 1961. ''Aristotle: De Anima''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The quotation is from page 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's scholars have tended to re-assess Aristotle's interpretation and been more positive about it.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Douglas R. Campbell, &quot;Located in Space: Plato's Theory of Psychic Motion,&quot; ''Ancient Philosophy'' 42 (2): 419â€“442. 2022.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's other criticism is that Plato's view of reincarnation entails that it is possible for a soul and its body to be mis-matched; in principle, Aristotle alleges, any soul can go with any body, according to Plato's theory.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' I.3''.''407b14â€“27. Christopher Shields summarizes it thus: &quot;We might think that an old leather-bound edition of Machiavelli's ''The Prince'' could come to bear the departed soul of Richard Nixon. Aristotle regards this sort of view as worthy of ridicule.â€ See Shields, C. 2016. ''Aristotle: De Anima''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The quotation is from page 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's claim that the soul is the form of a living being eliminates that possibility and thus rules out reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;There's a large scholarly discussion of this dialectic between Plato and Aristotle here: Douglas R. Campbell, &quot;The Soul's Tool: Plato on the Usefulness of the Body,&quot; ''Elenchos'' 43 (1): 7â€“27. 2022.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Memory ====
According to Aristotle in ''On the Soul'', memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal &quot;appearance&quot; and an occurrence in the past.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=12}} In other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian {{Avoid wrap|'[[common sense]]'}}, and thinking.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=61}}{{sfn| Carruthers | 2007 | p=16}}

Aristotle uses the term 'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences, both for previous experience and present experience.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=25}}

Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=30}} Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of &quot;images&quot; is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=25}} Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression.{{sfn| Carruthers | 2007 | p=19}} Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=296}}

[[File:Aristotle Senses Perception Memory Dreams Action.svg| thumb | upright=2.25 | Senses, perception, memory, dreams, action in Aristotle's psychology. Impressions are stored in the [[sensorium]] (the heart), linked by his [[laws of association]] (similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]]).]]

Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], described in his [[laws of association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=259}}{{sfn | Sorabji | 2006 | p=54}}

==== Dreams ====
{{further | Dream#Other}}

Aristotle describes sleep in ''On Sleep and Wakefulness''.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405â€“423}} Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115â€“118}} or of digestion,{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405â€“23}} so it is vital to the body.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115â€“118}} While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep, they cannot have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep,{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115â€“18}} albeit differently,{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405â€“423}} unless they are weary.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115â€“118}}

Dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115â€“118}} Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then looks away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405â€“423}} When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115â€“118}} However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405â€“423}} So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience.{{sfn| Modrak | 2009 | pp=169â€“181}} During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405â€“423}} This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405â€“423}} In ''De Anima'' iii 3, Aristotle ascribes the ability to create, to store, and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination, ''phantasia''.{{sfn| Shields | 2016}}

One component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences.{{sfn| Webb | 1990 | pages=174â€“184}} Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.{{sfn| Modrak | 2009 | pp=169â€“181}}

=== Ethics ===
{{Main|Aristotelian ethics}}

Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, most notably including the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.{{sfn| Kraut | 2001}}

Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuchÄ“]]'' (''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency{{sfn|Humphreys|2009}}) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or sometimes &quot;well-being&quot;. To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''Ä“thikÄ“'' ''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretÄ“]]''), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.{{sfn| Nicomachean Ethics | ps= &amp;nbsp;Book I. See for example chapter 7.}}

Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.{{sfn| Nicomachean Ethics | p= Book VI}}

=== Politics ===
{{Main|Politics (Aristotle)}}

In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family, which in turn is prior to the individual, &quot;for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part&quot;.{{sfn| Politics | pp=1253a19â€“124}} He famously stated that &quot;man is by nature a political animal&quot; and argued that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality.{{sfn| Aristotle | 2009 | pages=320â€“321}} Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.{{sfn| Ebenstein | Ebenstein | 2002 | page=59}}

[[File:Aristotle's constitutions.svg| thumb|upright=1.5 | Aristotle's classifications of political constitutions.]]

The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political &quot;community&quot; or &quot;partnership&quot; (''koinÅnia'')&lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt;. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability&lt;!-- (1280b29â€“31) --&gt;, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: &quot;The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&lt;!-- (1281a1â€“3) --&gt;.&quot; This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of &quot;fear of violent death&quot; or its &quot;inconveniences&quot;.{{efn-ua | For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, Karl (1957) &quot;Aristotle Discovers the Economy&quot; in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78â€“115.}}

In ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]'', the character 'Aristotle' states:{{sfn| Hutchinson | Johnson | 2015 | p=22}}

{{blockquote | For we all agree that the most excellent man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.{{sfn| Hutchinson | Johnson | 2015 | p=22}}}}

As Plato's disciple Aristotle was rather critical concerning democracy and, following the outline of certain ideas from Plato's ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so-called mixed state:
{{blockquote| It is â€¦ constitutional to take â€¦ from oligarchy that offices are to be elected, and from democracy that this is not to be on a property-qualification. This then is the mode of the mixture; and the mark of a good mixture of democracy and oligarchy is when it is possible to speak of the same constitution as a democracy and as an oligarchy. |Aristotle. ''Politics'', Book 4, 1294b.10â€“18|source=}}[[Aristotle's views on women]] influenced later [[Western philosophy|Western philosophers]], who quoted him as an authority until the end of the [[Middle Ages]], but these views have been controversial in modern times. Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. The biological differences are a result of the fact that the female body is well-suited for reproduction, which changes her body temperature, which in turn makes her, in Aristotle's view, incapable of participating in political life.&lt;ref&gt;See Marguerite Deslauriers, &quot;Sexual Difference in Aristotle's Politics and His Biology,&quot; ''Classical World'' 102 3 (2009): 215â€“231.&lt;/ref&gt; On this ground, proponents of [[feminist metaphysics]] have accused Aristotle of [[misogyny]]{{sfn| Freeland | 1998}} and [[sexism]].{{sfn| Morsink | 1979 | pp=83â€“112}} However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his ''Rhetoric'' that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.{{efn-ua | &quot;Where, as among the Lacedaemonians, the state of women is bad, almost half of human life is spoilt.&quot;{{sfn| Rhetoric | p=Book I, Chapter 5}}}}

=== Economics ===
{{Main|Politics (Aristotle)}}

Aristotle made substantial contributions to [[economics|economic thought]], especially to thought in the Middle Ages.{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20â€“24}} In ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', Aristotle addresses the city, [[property]], and [[trade]]. His response to criticisms of [[private property]], in [[Lionel Robbins]]'s view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall [[utility]] of social arrangements.{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20â€“24}} Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from [[human nature]]. In ''Politics'', Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of [[money]].{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20â€“24}} Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or [[silver]].{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16â€“28}}

Aristotle's discussions on [[retail]] and [[interest]] was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a [[profit (economics)|profit]]. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16â€“28}}

Aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them &quot;commensurable&quot;.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16â€“28}} He goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, &quot;if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it&quot;.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16â€“28}}

=== Rhetoric ===
{{Rhetoric}}
{{Main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)}}

Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: ''[[ethos]]'' (an appeal to the speaker's character), ''[[pathos]]'' (an appeal to the audience's emotion), and ''[[logos]]'' (an appeal to logical reasoning).{{sfn| Garver | 1994 | pages=109â€“110}} He also categorizes rhetoric into three genres: [[epideictic]] (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), [[Forensic rhetoric|forensic]] (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue).{{sfn| Rorty | 1996 | pages=3â€“7}} Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical [[Proof (truth)|proofs]]: ''[[enthymeme]]'' (proof by [[syllogism]]) and ''[[paradeigma]]'' (proof by example).{{sfn| Grimaldi | 1998 | p=71}}

=== Poetics ===
{{Main|Poetics (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle writes in his ''Poetics'' that [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]], painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of ''[[mimesis]]'' (&quot;imitation&quot;), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152â€“159}}{{sfn| Poetics | p= I 1447a}} He applies the term ''mimesis'' both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152â€“159}} and contends that the audience's realisation of the ''mimesis'' is vital to understanding the work itself.{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152â€“159}} Aristotle states that ''mimesis'' is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152â€“159}}{{sfn| Poetics | p= IV}} and that all human artistry &quot;follows the pattern of nature&quot;.{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152â€“159}} Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what [[Stephen Halliwell (academic)|Stephen Halliwell]] calls &quot;highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.&quot;{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152â€“59}} For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation â€“ through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.{{sfn| Poetics | p=III}}

[[File:BÃ©nigne Gagneraux, The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods.jpg| thumb | upright=1.35 | ''The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods'' (1784) by [[BÃ©nigne Gagneraux]]. In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle uses the tragedy ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus Tyrannus]]'' by [[Sophocles]] as an example of how the perfect tragedy should be structured, with a generally good protagonist who starts the play prosperous, but loses everything through some ''[[hamartia]]'' (fault).{{sfn| Kaufmann | 1968 | pages=56â€“60}}]]

While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' originally comprised two books â€“ one on comedy and one on tragedy â€“ only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.{{sfn| Poetics | p=VI}} The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.{{sfn| Poetics | p=XXVI}} Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].{{sfn| Aesop | 1998 | pages=Introduction, xiâ€“xii}}

More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | p=8}}{{sfn| Aristotle's Influence | 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/whos-more-famous-than-jesus.html|title=Who's More Famous Than Jesus?|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 March 2014 |first1=Dwight |last1=Garner.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210401095825/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/whos-more-famous-than-jesus.html|archive-date=1 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher [[Bryan Magee]], &quot;it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did&quot;.{{sfn| Magee | 2010 | page=34}}

Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of [[formal logic]],{{sfn| Guthrie | 1990 | page=156}}&lt;!--{{sfn| Case | p=518}}--&gt; pioneered the study of [[zoology]], and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.{{sfn| Aristotle (Greek philosopher)}}{{sfn| Durant | 2006 | page=92}}{{sfn| Kukkonen | 2010 | pages=70â€“77}} Taneli Kukkonen, observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing &quot;every branch of intellectual enterprise&quot; including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric, and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today &quot;will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind.&quot;{{sfn| Kukkonen | 2010 | pages=70â€“77}} [[Jonathan Barnes]] wrote that &quot;an account of Aristotle's intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought&quot;.{{sfn| Barnes | 1982 | page=86}}

{{Main|Theophrastus | Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)}}
[[File:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg| thumb | upright | [[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to a 1644 version of [[Theophrastus]]'s ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'', originally written around 300 BC.]]

Aristotle's pupil and successor, [[Theophrastus]], wrote the ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|History of Plants]]'', a pioneering work in botany. Some of his technical terms remain in use, such as [[carpel]] from ''carpos'', fruit, and [[pericarp]], from ''pericarpion'', seed chamber.{{sfn| Hooker | 1831 | page=219}}
Theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than Aristotle was, instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned.{{sfn| Mayr | 1982 | pp= 90â€“91}}{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | p= 46}}

=== Later Greek philosophy ===
{{further | Peripatetic school}}

The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the [[Lyceum]] grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle's students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and Theophrastus. Aristotle's influence over [[Alexander the Great]] is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about [[Persian people|Persian]] customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained &quot;Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?&quot;{{sfn| Plutarch | 1919 | p= Part 1, 7:7}}

=== Hellenistic science ===
{{further | Ancient Greek medicine}}

After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.{{sfn| Annas | 2001 | page=252}} It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.

The first medical teacher at Alexandria, [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | p= 56}} Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, [[teleology]] (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Ernst Mayr]] states that there was &quot;nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and [[Galen]] until the Renaissance.&quot;{{sfn| Mayr | 1985 | pp=90â€“94}}

=== Revival ===
Following the decline of the Roman Empire, Aristotle's vast philosophical and scientific corpus lay largely dormant in the West. However, his works underwent a remarkable revival in the Abbasid Caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gutas |first=Dimitri |title=The Graeco-Arabic Translation Movement in Baghdad and Early 'Abbasaid Society |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0415061339 |edition=1st |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated into Arabic alongside other Greek classics, Aristotle's logic, ethics, and natural philosophy ignited the minds of early Islamic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Admin |date=2017-02-13 |title=The Reception of Aristotelian Science in Early Islam: A Historical Account |url=https://www.ihc.ucsb.edu/reception-of-aristotelian-science/ |access-date=2024-01-27 |website=Interdisciplinary Humanities Center UCSB |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through meticulous commentaries and critical engagements, figures like [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) breathed new life into Aristotle's ideas. They harmonized his logic with Islamic theology, employed his scientific methodologies to explore the natural world, and even reinterpreted his ethics within the framework of Islamic morality. This revival was not mere imitation. Islamic thinkers embraced Aristotle's rigorous methods while simultaneously challenging his conclusions where they diverged from their own religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fakhry |first=Professor Majid |title=A History of Islamic Philosophy |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1987 |isbn=978-0231055338 |edition=2nd |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Byzantine scholars ===
{{See also|Commentaries on Aristotle | Byzantine Aristotelianism}}

Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and [[Stephen of Alexandria]] in the early seventh century.{{sfn| Sorabji | 1990 | pages=20, 28, 35â€“36}} [[John Philoponus]] stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.{{sfn| Sorabji | 1990 | pages=233â€“724}} Philoponus questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics, noting its flaws and introducing the [[theory of impetus]] to explain his observations.{{sfn|Lindberg|1992|p=162}}

After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and [[Michael of Ephesus]] reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by [[Anna Comnena]].{{sfn|Sorabji|1990|pp=20â€“21, 28â€“29, 393â€“406, 407â€“408}}

Aristotle was one of the most revered thinkers in early [[Islamic theology]]. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle,{{sfn|Kennedy-Day|1998}} as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars. [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Alpharabius]], who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. [[Alkindus]] greatly admired Aristotle's philosophy,{{sfn|Staley|1989}} and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the &quot;exemplar&quot; for all future philosophers.{{sfn|Averroes|1953|p=III, 2, 43}} Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the &quot;First Teacher&quot;.{{sfn|Kennedy-Day|1998}} The title was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]) who were influenced by the tradition of [[Islamic philosophy]].{{sfn|Nasr|1996|pp=59â€“60}}

=== Medieval Europe ===
{{further|Aristotelianism|Syllogism#Medieval}}

With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early [[medieval]] Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from {{Circa|CE 600}} to {{Circa|1100}} except through the Latin translation of the ''Organon'' made by [[Boethius]]. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by [[Gerard of Cremona]],{{sfn| Hasse | 2014}} and from the original Greek, such as those by [[James of Venice]] and [[William of Moerbeke]].

After the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] Thomas Aquinas wrote his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', working from Moerbeke's translations and calling Aristotle &quot;The Philosopher&quot;,{{sfn|Aquinas|2013}} the demand for Aristotle's writings grew, and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn| Kuhn | 2018}} These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Boethius, [[Peter Abelard]], and [[John Buridan]] worked on Aristotelian logic.{{sfn| Lagerlund}}

According to scholar Roger Theodore Lafferty, [[Dante]] built up the philosophy of the ''[[Divine Comedy|Comedy]]'' with the works of Aristotle as a foundation, just as the scholastics used Aristotle as the basis for their thinking. Dante knew Aristotle directly from Latin translations of his works and indirectly through quotations in the works of [[Albert Magnus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lafferty, Roger. &quot;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40165857.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A55f6bfc22f02768d5dcdc92005228933 The Philosophy of Dante]&quot;, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Dante even acknowledges Aristotle's influence explicitly in the poem, specifically when Virgil justifies the Inferno's structure by citing the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto&amp;nbsp;XI, lines 70â€“115, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante famously refers to him as &quot;he / Who is acknowledged Master of those who know&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto&amp;nbsp;IV, lines 115-16 trans., 131 original, Robert Pinksky translation (1994); note to line, p.384&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| Kukkonen | 2010 | page=74}}

=== Medieval Judaism ===
[[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] (considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of medieval Judaism)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Moses Maimonides|encyclopedia=Britannica|date=26 March 2023 |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moses-Maimonides}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' on it and that became the basis of Jewish [[scholastic philosophy]]. Maimonides also considered Aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived, and styled him as the &quot;chief of the philosophers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Levi ben Gershom, The Wars of the Lord: Book one, Immortality of the soul, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leon Simon, Aspects Of The Hebrew Genius: A Volume Of Essays On Jewish Literature And Thought (1910), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Davidson, Herbert A. |q (Herbert Alan) Davidson, Professor of Hebrew Emeritus Herbert Davidson, Moses Maimonides: The Man and His Works, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in his letter to [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], Maimonides observes that there is no need for Samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded Aristotle because the works of the latter are &quot;sufficient by themselves and [superior] to all that were written before them. His intellect, Aristotle's is the extreme limit of human intellect, apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy, there being no level higher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Menachem Kellner, Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish People, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Modern science ===
[[File:William Harvey ( 1578-1657) Venenbild.jpg| thumb | [[William Harvey]]'s ''[[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus|De Motu Cordis]]'', 1628, showed that the [[circulation of the blood|blood circulated]], contrary to classical era thinking.]]

In the [[Early Modern]] period, scientists such as [[William Harvey]] in England and [[Galileo Galilei]] in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like [[Galen]], establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment. Harvey demonstrated the [[circulation of the blood]], establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's heat, as Aristotle thought.{{sfn| Aird | 2011 | pp=118â€“29}} Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle's physics, proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight.{{sfn| Machamer | 2017}}

=== 18th and 19th-century science ===
The English mathematician [[George Boole]] fully accepted Aristotle's logic, but decided &quot;to go under, over, and beyond&quot; it with his system of [[Boolean algebra|algebraic logic]] in his 1854 book ''[[The Laws of Thought]]''. This gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check [[Validity (logic)|validity]], and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two.{{sfn|Boole|2003}}

[[Charles Darwin]] regarded Aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology. In an 1882 letter he wrote that &quot;Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkins 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkins |first=John |title=Species: a history of the idea |publisher=[[University of California Press]] | publication-place=Berkeley |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-520-27139-5 |oclc=314379168 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasipoularides 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Pasipoularides |first=Ares |title=The heart's vortex: intracardiac blood flow phenomena |publisher=People's Medical Publishing House |publication-place=Shelton, Connecticut |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-60795-033-2 |oclc=680621287 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in later editions of the book &quot;[[On the Origin of Species]]', Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F391&amp;pageseq=18 xiii]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Aristotle |title=Physics |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html |access-date=23 April 2009 |publisher=translated by Hardie, R.

=== Present science ===
The philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] claims that &quot;almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine&quot;. Russell calls Aristotle's ethics &quot;repulsive&quot;, and labelled his logic &quot;as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy&quot;. Russell states that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.{{sfn|Russell|1972|loc=Chapter 19 &quot;Aristotle's Metaphysics&quot;}}

The Dutch historian of science [[Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis]] writes that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by &quot;proceed[ing] so readily to frame a theory of such a general character&quot; on limited evidence from their senses.{{sfn|Dijksterhuis|1969|p=72}} In 1985, the biologist [[Peter Medawar]] could still state in &quot;pure seventeenth century&quot;{{sfn|Leroi|2015|p=353}} tones that Aristotle had assembled &quot;a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility&quot;.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|p=353}}{{sfn|Medawar|Medawar|1984|p=28}}

Zoologists have frequently mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports. However, modern observation has confirmed several of his more surprising claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ogilvie |first=Brian W. |chapter=Zoology |editor1=Grafton, Anthony |editor2=Most, Glenn W. |editor3=Settis, Salvatore |title=The Classical Tradition |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=2010 |isbn=978-0-674-07227-5 |pages=1000â€“1001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=Peter |date=2009 |title=[[Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage]] |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=978-0-300-12539-9 |pages=236â€“239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=137â€“138}} Aristotle's work remains largely unknown to modern scientists, though zoologists sometimes mention him as the father of biology{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=352}} or in particular of [[marine biology]].&lt;ref name=MarineBio&gt;{{cite web |title=A History of the Study of Marine Biology |url=http://marinebio.org/oceans/history-of-marine-biology/ |publisher=MarineBio Conservation Society |access-date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practising zoologists are unlikely to adhere to Aristotle's chain of being, but its influence is still perceptible in the use of the terms &quot;lower&quot; and &quot;upper&quot; to designate taxa such as groups of plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rigato &amp; Minelli 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rigato |first1=Emanuele |last2=Minelli |first2=Alessandro |title=The great chain of being is still here |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |date=28 June 2013 |volume=6 |issue=18 |pages=1â€“6 |doi=10.1186/1936-6434-6-18 |url=http://www.evolution-outreach.com/content/6/1/18 |issn=1936-6434|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary biologist [[Armand Marie Leroi]] has reconstructed Aristotle's biology,{{sfn|Leroi|2015}} while [[Tinbergen's four questions|Niko Tinbergen's four questions]], based on Aristotle's four causes, are used to analyse [[animal behaviour]]; they examine [[function (biology)|function]], [[phylogeny]], [[mechanism (biology)|mechanism]], and [[ontogeny]].{{sfn|MacDougall-Shackleton|2011|pp=2076â€“2085}}{{sfn|HladkÃ½|HavlÃ­Äek|2013}} The concept of [[Homology (biology)|homology]] began with Aristotle;&lt;ref name=&quot;Panchen 1999 pp. 5â€“18; discussion 18â€“23&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Panchen | first=A.

=== Corpus Aristotelicum ===
{{main|Works of Aristotle}}

[[File:Aristotelis De Moribus ad Nicomachum.jpg| thumb | upright | First page of a 1566 edition of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in Greek and Latin.]]

The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=9}} Reference to them is made according to the organization of [[Immanuel Bekker]]'s Royal Prussian Academy edition (''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', Berlin, 1831â€“1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.{{sfn|Aristotelis Opera}}

=== Loss and preservation ===
{{further|Transmission of the Greek Classics}}

Aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls, the common writing medium of that era.{{efn-ua|&quot;When the Roman dictator Sulla invaded Athens in 86 BC, he brought back to Rome a fantastic prize â€“ Aristotle's library. Books then were papyrus rolls, from 10 to 20 feet long, and since Aristotle's death in 322 BC, worms and damp had done their worst. The rolls needed repairing, and the texts clarifying and copying on to new papyrus (imported from Egypt â€“ Moses' bulrushes). The man in Rome who put Aristotle's library in order was a Greek scholar, Tyrannio.&quot;{{sfn|When libraries were|2001}}}} His writings are divisible into two groups: the &quot;[[exoteric]]&quot;, intended for the public, and the &quot;[[esoteric]]&quot;, for use within the [[Lyceum (classical)|Lyceum]] school.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=12}}{{efn-ua|1=Aristotle: ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1102a26â€“27. Aristotle himself never uses the term &quot;esoteric&quot; or &quot;acroamatic&quot;. For other passages where Aristotle speaks of ''exÅterikoi logoi'', see [[W.D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 2 pp= 408â€“410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to &quot;discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic school]]&quot;, rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.}}{{sfn|House|1956|page=35}} Aristotle's &quot;lost&quot; works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication, the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication.{{sfn|Irwin|Fine|1996|pp= xiâ€“xii}}{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=12}} [[Cicero]]'s description of Aristotle's literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot; must have applied to the published works, not the surviving notes.{{efn-ua|&quot;''veniet flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles''&quot;, (Google translation: &quot;Aristotle will come pouring forth a golden stream of eloquence&quot;).{{sfn|Cicero|1874}}}} A major question in the history of Aristotle's works is how the exoteric writings were all lost, and how the ones now possessed came to be found.{{sfn|Barnes|Griffin|1999|pages=1â€“69}} The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.{{sfn|Anagnostopoulos|2013|page=16}}{{sfn|Barnes|1995|pp=10â€“15}}

According to [[Strabo]] and [[Plutarch]], after Aristotle's death, his library and writings went to [[Theophrastus]] (Aristotle's successor as head of the Lycaeum and the [[Peripatetic school]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Sketches |author=Strabo |author-link=Strabo |volume=XIII |number=1}}

Some time later, the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]] began conscripting books for a royal library, and the heirs of Neleus hid their collection in a cellar to prevent it from being seized for that purpose. The library was stored there for about a century and a half, in conditions that were not ideal for document preservation. On the death of [[Attalus III]], which also ended the royal library ambitions, the existence of Aristotelian library was disclosed, and it was purchased by [[Apellicon]] and returned to Athens in about 100 BC.{{r|Grant|pages=5â€“6}}

Apellicon sought to recover the texts, many of which were seriously degraded at this point due to the conditions in which they were stored. He had them copied out into new manuscripts, and used his best guesswork to fill in the gaps where the originals were unreadable.{{r|Grant|pages=5â€“6}}

When [[Sulla]] seized Athens in 86 BC, he seized the library and transferred it to Rome. There, [[Andronicus of Rhodes]] organized the texts into the first complete edition of Aristotle's works (and works attributed to him).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life of Plotinus |author=Porphyry |author-link=Porphyry (philosopher) |at=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aristotelian texts we have today are based on these.{{r|Grant|pages=6â€“8}}

Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]],{{sfn| Lucas Cranach the Elder}} [[Justus van Gent]], [[Raphael]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]],{{sfn| Lee | Robinson | 2005}} [[Rembrandt]],{{sfn| Aristotle with Bust | 2002}} and [[Francesco Hayez]] over the centuries.

'''''An American in Paris''''' is a [[Jazz|jazz-influenced]] [[symphonic poem]] (or [[tone poem]])&lt;ref name=&quot;TH-20170401&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=An American in Paris |url=https://theatricalia.com/play/e69/an-american-in-paris |date=April 1, 2017 |work=Theatricalia.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20230831150800/https://theatricalia.com/play/e69/an-american-in-paris |archivedate=August 31, 2023 |accessdate=August 31, 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for orchestra by American composer [[George Gershwin]] first performed in 1928. It was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in [[Paris]] and evokes the sights and energy of the French capital during the ''{{Lang|fr|[[AnnÃ©es folles]]}}''.

Gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], saxophones, and automobile horns. He brought back four Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928, in [[Carnegie Hall]], with [[Walter Damrosch]] conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |title=Rhapsody in Blue for Piano and Orchestra : An American in Paris |author=George Gershwin |website=Nyphil.org |access-date=April 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052949/http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/newsroom/1314/Releases/gilbert-ozone-final.pdf Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic: Makoto Ozone to Perform Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' in One-Night-Only Concert All-American Program Also to Include Bernstein's ''Candide'' Overture and Symphonic Dances from ''West Side Story'' Gershwin's ''An American in Paris'': April 22, 2014 at nyphil.org] Accessed June 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was Damrosch who had commissioned Gershwin to write his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]] following the earlier success of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1924).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/An-American-in-Paris-by-Gershwin &quot;''An American in Paris''&quot;], by Betsy Schwarm, ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2983 | title = ''An American in Paris'': About the Work | publisher = [[The Kennedy Center]] | author=Richard Freed|author-link=Richard Freed| access-date=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The George Gershwin Reader|editor1-last=Wyatt|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Johnson|editor2-first=John Andrew|date=2004|author=[[Deems Taylor]]|chapter=33.

==Background==
Although the story is likely apocryphal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schwartz |first=Charles |url=https://archive.org/details/gershwinhislifem00sch_3az |title=George Gershwin: His Life and Music |date=1973 |isbn=0-672-51662-4 |url-access=registration|page=154|publisher=[[Bobbs-Merrill Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gershwin is said to have been attracted by [[Maurice Ravel]]'s unusual chords, and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study with Ravel. After his initial student audition with Ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories, Ravel said he could not teach him, saying, &quot;Why be a second-rate Ravel when you can be a first-rate Gershwin?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Schiff |first=David |author-link=David Schiff |date=October 1, 1998 |title=Misunderstanding Gershwin |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/10/misunderstanding-gershwin/377252/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215222801/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/10/misunderstanding-gershwin/377252/ |archive-date=Dec 15, 2018 |access-date=December 11, 2018 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gershwin strongly encouraged Ravel to come to the United States for a tour. To this end, upon his return to New York, Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravel's friend [[E. Robert Schmitz|Robert Schmitz]], a pianist Ravel had met during the war, to urge Ravel to tour the U.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica, promoting Franco-American musical relations, and was able to offer Ravel a $10,000 fee for the tour, an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goss&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bolerolifeofmaur1940goss |title=Bolero: the life of Maurice Ravel |last=Goss |first=Madeleine |publisher=New York, H.

Gershwin greeted Ravel in New York in March 1928 during a party held for Ravel's birthday by [[Ã‰va Gauthier]].&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://csosoundsandstories.org/fascinatin-rhythm-when-ravel-met-gershwin-in-jazz-age-new-york/ |title=Fascinatin' rhythm: When Ravel met Gershwin in Jazz Age New York |last=Burton |first=Louise |date=May 26, 2015 |website=CSO Sounds &amp; Stories |publisher=[[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] |access-date=December 11, 2018 |archive-date=January 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220121135409/https://csosoundsandstories.org/fascinatin-rhythm-when-ravel-met-gershwin-in-jazz-age-new-york/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel's tour reignited Gershwin's desire to return to Paris, which he and his brother [[Ira Gershwin|Ira]] did after meeting Ravel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerswhin.com&quot; /&gt; Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to [[Nadia Boulanger]] caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris. Yet after he played for her, she told him she could not teach him. Boulanger gave Gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students: &quot;What could I give you that you haven't already got?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spycket1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-VcUAeWQr0C&amp;pg=PA71|title=Nadia Boulanger|author=JÃ©rÃ´me Spycket|publisher=Pendragon Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-945193-38-8|pages=71â€“73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack2007&quot; /&gt; This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]''. Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers, among them [[Ezra Pound]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and artist [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;LSRI Archives Oral Interview Anita Loos and Mary Anita Loos October 1979 re: letters and Ravel's telegram to Gershwin&lt;/ref&gt;

Gershwin based ''An American in Paris'' on a melodic fragment called &quot;Very Parisienne&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerswhin.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gershwin.com/publications/an-american-in-paris-concert-work/ |title=An American in Paris |website=Gershwin Enterprises |access-date=December 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. Gershwin called it &quot;a rhapsodic ballet&quot;; it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works.&lt;ref name=&quot;JablonskiStewart1958&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/gershwinyearsgeo00jabl|url-access=registration|title=The Gershwin Years: George And Ira|author1=Edward Jablonski|author-link=Edward Jablonski|author2=Lawrence D.

Gershwin explained in ''[[Musical America]]'', &quot;My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RySwdc151ZoC&amp;pg=PA431|title=George Gershwin: His Life and Work|author=Howard Pollack|author-link=Howard Pollack|date=January 15, 2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93314-9|pages=119, 431â€“440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=''An American in Paris'' performance material|url=https://www.schott-music.com/en/an-american-in-paris-no251041.html|access-date=2022-12-12|publisher=[[Schott Music]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose [[Ternary form|Aâ€“Bâ€“A format]]. Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main &quot;walking&quot; themes in the &quot;Allegretto grazioso&quot; and develops a third theme in the &quot;Subito con brio&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Van Dyke|first=Joseph M.|year=2011|title=George Gershwin's An American in Paris for Two Pianos: A Critical Score Study and Performance Guide|type=Doctoral thesis|location=Columbus, Ohio|publisher=OhioLINK Electronic Theses and Dissertations Center|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1298660291|access-date=September 14, 2017|archive-date=September 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914172912/https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1298660291|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Les Six]].&lt;ref name=Burton /&gt; This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section's &quot;Andante ma con ritmo deciso&quot; introduces the American [[Blues]] and spasms of homesickness. The &quot;Allegro&quot; that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster [[twelve-bar blues]]. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. &quot;Moderato con grazia&quot; is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the &quot;walking&quot; themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final &quot;Grandioso&quot;.

Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of ''An American in Paris''. He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with &quot;a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2013-09-08 |title=Who Could Ask For Anything More |url=https://smtd.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?parallax-sections=who-could-ask-for-anything-more |access-date=2022-12-12 |website=The Gershwin Initiative Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics believed that ''An American in Paris'' was better crafted than Gershwin's [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack2007&quot; /&gt; ''Evening Post'' did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[CÃ©sar Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics:

{{Blockquote|It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack2007&quot; /&gt;}}

==Instrumentation==
''An American in Paris'' was originally scored for 3 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B-flat]], [[bass clarinet]] in B-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B-flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]], [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]], [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 [[vehicle horn|taxi horns]] labeled as A, B, C, and D with circles around them, [[alto saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone saxophone]] (all doubling [[soprano saxophone|soprano]] and alto saxophones), and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/47d1f79a-8ea6-4aba-964f-989cb5dc2cd7/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|title=George Gershwin: An American in Paris (original score)|website=New York Philharmonic Archives|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904200637/http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/47d1f79a-8ea6-4aba-964f-989cb5dc2cd7/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.schott-music.com/en/preview/viewer/index/?idx=MjUxMDQx&amp;idy=251041&amp;dl=0|title=An American in Paris|author=George Gershwin|year=1930|type=full orchestral score|publisher=[[Chappell &amp; Co.]]|location=London|access-date=2023-07-25|via=[[Schott Music]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A, B, C, and D, it had been Gershwin's intention to use the notes A{{Music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;[[Scientific pitch notation|4]]&lt;/sub&gt;, B{{Music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/theater/have-we-been-playing-gershwin-wrong-for-70-years.html|title=Have We Been Playing Gershwin Wrong for 70 Years?|last=Cooper |first=Michael |date=March 1, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A, B, C, and D with circles, he was referring to the four horns, and not the notes that they played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?p=715 |last=Clague |first=Mark |title=1929 Gershwin Taxi Horn Photo Clarifies Mystery|publisher=[[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance]]|date=March 5, 2016|access-date=April 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major revision of the work by composer and arranger F. Campbell-Watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments: alto, tenor and baritone; the soprano and alto saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments.{{efn|1=Compare the original 1930 publication and Frank Campbell-Watson revision, both published by New World Music Corporation (New York); the date on both publications is 1930, although the revision is ca. 1942. The original is reprinted by Musikproduktion Hoeflich (Munich), Repertoire Explorer No. 4007 (2018), although James Dalton's preface incorrectly states this reprint has the Campbell-Watson revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repertoire-explorer.musikmph.de/wp-content/uploads/vorworte_prefaces/4007.html|title=George Gershwin â€“ ''An American in Paris'' â€“ Preface|author=James Dalton|date=2018|access-date=July 25, 2022|website=repertoire-explorer.musikmph.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant saxophone passages may be found on pages 76â€“94 in both scores.}} This became the standard performing edition until 2000, when Gershwin specialist [[Jack Gibbons]] made his own restoration of the original orchestration of ''An American in Paris'', working directly from Gershwin's original manuscript, including the restoration of Gershwin's soprano saxophone parts removed in Campbell-Watson's revision.&lt;ref name=&quot;gibbons&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jackgibbons.com/reviews.htm|title=Musical Opinion review of Gershwin Spectacular|access-date=June 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbons' restored orchestration of ''An American in Paris'' was performed at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall on July 9, 2000, by the City of Oxford Orchestra conducted by Levon Parikian.&lt;ref name=&quot;gibbons&quot;/&gt;

[[William Merrigan Daly|William Daly]] arranged the score for piano solo; this was published by New World Music in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ljms.org/directory/ |title=CMS: ''An American in Paris'' Program Notes |last=Rodda |first=Richard E. |date=2013 |website=La Jolla Music Society |access-date=December 11, 2018 |archive-date=August 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813075416/https://ljms.org/directory |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.free-scores.com/download-sheet-music.php?pdf=82579 |title=Free sheet music : Gershwin, George â€“ ''An American in Paris'' (Piano solo) |website=www.free-scores.com |access-date=December 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation status==
On September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological [[Historical editions (music)|critical edition]] of the full orchestral score would be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[University of Michigan]], were working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent. It was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin's composition process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-critical-edition-of-george-and-ira-gershwins-works-to-be-compiled/ |title=New, critical edition of George and Ira Gershwin's works to be compiled|work=[[PBS NewsHour]]|date=September 14, 2013 |access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The score to ''An American in Paris'' was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released. The entire project was expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete, but ''An American in Paris'' was planned to be an early volume in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?page_id=59 |title=The Editions Â» Gershwin |website=Music.umich.edu |date= September 8, 2013|access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://musicologynow.ams-net.org/2013/09/george-and-ira-gershwin-critical-edition_20.html |title=Musicology Now: George and Ira Gershwin Critical Edition |website=Musicologynow.ams-net.org |date=September 17, 2013 |access-date=April 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215122523/http://musicologynow.ams-net.org/2013/09/george-and-ira-gershwin-critical-edition_20.html |archive-date=December 15, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[urtext edition]]s of the work were published by the German publisher B-Note Music in 2015. The changes made by Campbell-Watson were withdrawn in both editions. In the extended urtext, 120 bars of music were re-integrated. Conductor Walter Damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''An American in Paris'' Urtext | url=https://www.bnote.de/?set=werk_detail&amp;kompid=246&amp;bnnr=16963&amp;lc=en|website=Bnote.de |access-date=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2017, The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra gave the world premiere of the long-awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by Mark Clague, director of the Gershwin initiative at the University of Michigan. This performance was of the original 1928 orchestration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eamdc.com/news/critical-edition-of-george-gershwins-an-american-in-paris-debuts-with-the-cincinnati-and-atlanta-symphony-orchestras/ |title= Critical Edition of George Gershwin's ''An American in Paris'' Debuts with the Cincinnati and Atlanta Symphony Orchestras |date=September 1, 2017 |access-date=July 18, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=''An American in Paris'' by George Gershwin|url=https://www.whosampled.com/George-Gershwin/An-American-in-Paris/ |access-date=2022-12-12|website=[[WhoSampled]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recording was made for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to &quot;supervise&quot; the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A-flat, B-flat, a higher D, and a lower A.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot; /&gt;

The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937, Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which ''An American in Paris,'' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

[[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] conducting the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the piece for [[RCA Victor]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pollack |first=Howard |url=http://california.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1525/california/9780520248649.001.0001/upso-9780520248649 |title=George GershwinHis Life and Work |date=2007-01-15 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-24864-9 |doi=10.1525/california/9780520248649.003.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seattle Symphony]] also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin's original score, before numerous edits were made resulting in the score as we hear it today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bargreen|first=Melinda|url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900628&amp;slug=1079541|title=Recordings|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=June 28, 1990|access-date=July 25, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blues section of ''An American in Paris'' has been recorded separately by a number of artists; [[Ralph Flanagan]] &amp; His Orchestra released it as a single in 1951 which reached No. 15 on the ''Billboard'' chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NP6OdDrutyAC&amp;pg=PA22|title=Hit Records, 1950-1975|first= David F.|last= Lonergan |date= 2005|page=22 |isbn=9780810851290 |publisher=Scarecrow Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry James]] released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album ''One Night Stand,'' recorded live at the [[Aragon Ballroom (Chicago)|Aragon Ballroom in Chicago]] ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]] GL 522 and CL 522).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Columbia Album Discography (1951-55) |url=https://www.bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia500.html |access-date=2024-03-29 |website=www.bsnpubs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in film==
In 1951, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released the musical film ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]] and directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]]. Winning the [[24th Academy Awards|1951 Best Picture Oscar]] and numerous other awards, the film featured many tunes of Gershwin and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the symphonic poem ''An American in Paris'' (arranged for the film by [[Johnny Green]]), which at the time was the most expensive musical number ever filmed, costing $500,000 {{USDCY|500000|1951}}.&lt;ref&gt;The Eddie Mannix Ledger, Los Angeles: Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://daily.jstor.org/american-paris-onstage-onscreen/|title=''An American in Paris'': Onstage and Onscreen {{!}} JSTOR Daily|date=May 19, 2015|work=JSTOR Daily|access-date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Academy Award for Best Production Design''' recognizes achievement for [[art direction]] in [[film]]. The category's original name was '''Best Art Direction''', but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the [[85th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Rules&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2012/20120830.html |title=Music Rules Approved for 85th Academy Awards |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004163009/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2012/20120830.html |archive-date=2014-10-04 |access-date=2012-08-31 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change resulted from the Art Directors' branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) being renamed the Designers' branch. Since [[19th Academy Awards|1947]], the award is shared with the set decorators. It is awarded to the best interior design in a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/best-art-direction-10.html |title=Academy Award for Best Art Direction |website=Awardsandshows.com |access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The films below are listed with their production year (for example, the [[72nd Academy Awards|2000 Academy Award]] for Best Art Direction is given to a film from 1999). In the lists below, the winner of the award for each year is shown first, followed by the other nominees in alphabetical order.

== History ==
The [[1st Academy Awards|first Academy Awards]] presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at [[The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]], with an audience of about 270 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 1st Academy Awards {{!}} 1929 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1929 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001234905/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1929 |archive-date=October 1, 2019 |access-date=October 29, 2019 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date=October 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dunhill Hotel |url=https://www.virtlo.com/countries/united-states-of-america/north-carolina-guide/accommodation-hotels/the-dunhill-hotel-4162852766-n |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220319041113/https://www.virtlo.com/countries/united-states-of-america/north-carolina-guide/accommodation-hotels/the-dunhill-hotel-4162852766-n |archive-date=March 19, 2022 |access-date=March 16, 2022 |website=[[Virtlo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Academy Awards |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706040444/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html |archive-date=July 6, 2010 |website=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 - ${{Inflation|US|5|1929}} at {{Inflation-year|US}} prices. Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors, and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927â€“28 period. The ceremony ran for 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.

For this first ceremony, winners were announced to the media three months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=First Academy Awards announced {{!}} February 18, 1929 |url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-academy-awards-announced |access-date=2024-05-22 |website=HISTORY |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second ceremony in 1930, and the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; In 1940, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began. As a result, in 1941 the Academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

The term &quot;Oscar&quot; is a registered trademark of the AMPAS. In the Italian language, it is used [[generic trademark|generically]] to refer to any award or award ceremony, regardless of which field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Court: 'Oscar' may be generic term in Italian |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/court-oscar-may-be-generic-132235 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217200730/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/court-oscar-may-be-generic-132235 |archive-date=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Court: Oscar may be generic term in Italian |work=[[Reuters]] |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/industry-oscar-dc-idUKN1527923720070316 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429045816/http://uk.reuters.com/article/industry-oscar-dc-idUKN1527923720070316 |archive-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milestones ===
The first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier. This made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period. For example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

At the 29th ceremony, held in 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category, now known as [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]], was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.

Perhaps the most widely seen [[streaking|streaker]] in history was 34-year-old [[Robert Opel]], who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974. Bemused host [[David Niven]] quipped, &quot;Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?&quot;. Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show's producer [[Jack Haley Jr.]]

Robert Metzler, the show's business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way. During the dress rehearsal, Niven had asked Metzler's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the [[Ad libitum|ad-lib]] it appeared to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harvey |first=Steve |date=March 29, 1993 |title=What You Won't See at Oscars On Cue: Behind Those Cameras on Oscar Night |page=F1 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-29-ca-16650-story.html |url-status=live |access-date=March 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212307/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-29-ca-16650-story.html |archive-date=November 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies, except for 2021, have ended with the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Traditionally, the previous year's winners for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. The previous year's winners for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.

Made of gold-plated [[bronze]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34.3&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.856&amp;nbsp;kg), and depicts a knight rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oscar Statuette: Legacy |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html/?pn=statuette |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172055/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html/?pn=statuette |archive-date=December 11, 2013 |access-date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptor [[George Stanley (sculptor)|George Stanley]], who also did the Muse Fountain at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], sculpted [[Cedric Gibbons]]' design. The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze. Within a few years, the bronze was abandoned in favor of [[Britannia metal]], a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-karat gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;statuette&quot;/&gt; Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oscar Statuette: Manufacturing, Shipping and Repairs |url=http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927134712/http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |access-date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the [[C.W.

=== Naming ===
The origin of the nickname of the trophy has been disputed, as multiple people have taken credit for naming the trophy &quot;Oscar&quot;.

[[Margaret Herrick]], librarian and president of the Academy, may have said she named it after her supposed uncle Oscar in 1921.{{Efn|Sources conflict on if she actually said this. ''Deadline'' puts doubt on it, saying {{&quot;'}}He reminds me of my Uncle Oscar,' she was reported to have said, while in the hearing of a 'nearby newspaper columnist' who picked up the anecdote and ran with it the next day&quot;. ''Variety'' and ''The Hollywood Reporter'' state with certainty that she made a claim to the Oscar nickname.}} The only corroboration was a 1938 clipping from the ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'', in which Herrick told a story of her and her husband joking with each other using the phrase, &quot;How's your uncle Oscar&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;

[[Bette Davis]], in her 1962 autobiography, claimed she named it in 1936 after her first husband, Harmon Oscar Nelson, of whom the statue's rear end reminded her.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 18, 2015 |title=Oscars: Who Came Up With the Name &quot;Oscar&quot; and More About the Statuette's History (Video) |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-who-came-up-name-774775 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029231953/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-who-came-up-name-774775 |archive-date=October 29, 2019 |access-date=October 29, 2019 |website=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the term had been in use at least two years before. In a 1974 biography written by Whitney Stine with commentary from Davis, Davis wrote &quot;I relinquish once and for all any claim that I was the one â€” so, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the honor is all yours&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stine |first1=Whitney |title=Mother Goddam: The Story of the Career of Bette Davis |last2=Davis |first2=Bette |publisher=[[Hawthorn Books]] |year=1974 |isbn=0-8015-5184-6 |location=New York |page=74 |lccn=73-10265 |oclc=1150862598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columnist [[Sidney Skolsky]] wrote in his 1970 memoir that he came up with the term in 1934 under pressure for a deadline, mocking [[Vaudeville]] comedians who asked &quot;Will you have a cigar, Oscar?&quot; The Academy credits Skolsky with &quot;the first confirmed newspaper reference&quot; to ''Oscar'' in his column on March 16, 1934, which was written about that year's [[6th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 27, 2014 |title=The 6th Academy Awards Memorable Moments |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1934/memorable-moments |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226111216/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1934/memorable-moments |archive-date=February 26, 2019 |access-date=February 25, 2019 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the newspaper clipping that Skolsky referred to, he wrote that &quot;these statues are called 'Oscars{{'&quot;}}, meaning that the name was already in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;

Bruce Davis, a former executive director of the Academy, credited Eleanore Lilleberg, a secretary at the Academy when the award was first introduced, for the nickname. She had overseen the pre-ceremony handling of the awards. Davis credits Lilleberg because he found in an autobiography of Einar Lilleberg, Eleanore's brother, that Einar had referenced a Norwegian army veteran named Oscar that the two knew in Chicago, whom Einar described as having always &quot;stood straight and tall&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Cieply |first=Michael |date=June 26, 2022 |title=So, Once And For All (We Hope), Bruce Davis Settles Why They Call It 'Oscar' |url=https://deadline.com/2022/06/once-for-all-bruce-davis-settles-why-they-call-it-oscar-1235052129/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220626154131/https://deadline.com/2022/06/once-for-all-bruce-davis-settles-why-they-call-it-oscar-1235052129/ |archive-date=June 26, 2022 |access-date=June 26, 2022 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;/&gt; He asserts credit &quot;should almost certainly belong to&quot; Lilleberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;/&gt;

In 2021, Brazilian researcher Dr. [[Waldemar Dalenogare Neto]] found the probable first public mention of the name &quot;Oscar&quot;, in journalist [[Relman Morin]]'s &quot;Cinematters&quot; column in the ''[[Los Angeles Evening Post-Record]]'' on December 5, 1933. Since the awards didn't take place that year, he said: &quot;What's happened to the annual Academy banquet? As a rule, the banquet and the awarding of &quot;Oscar&quot;, the bronze statuette given for best performances, is all over long before this&quot;. This information changes the version of Sidney Skolsky as the first to publicly mention the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Dalenogare |first=Waldemar |date=2021-06-06 |title=Descoberta: primeira menÃ§Ã£o ao nome Oscar na imprensa |url=https://dalenogare.com/2021/06/descoberta-primeira-mencao-ao-nome-oscar-na-imprensa/ |access-date=2024-02-20 |website=Movie Reviews by Dalenogare |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engraving ===
To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. The R.S. Owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony, bearing the name of every potential winner. The nameplates for the non-winning nominees are later recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kilday |first=Greg |date=February 9, 2010 |title=Oscar statues to include engraved names |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-statues-include-engraved-names-20476 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412143119/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-statues-include-engraved-names-20476 |archive-date=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Daly |first=Steve |date=February 28, 2014 |title=Governors Ball Secrets: Welcome to the 'Engraving Station,' Where Oscar Statuettes Get Personalized |work=Parade Magazine |url=http://parade.com/266251/stevedaly/governors-ball-secrets-welcome-to-the-engraving-station-where-oscar-statuettes-get-personalized/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227170517/http://parade.com/266251/stevedaly/governors-ball-secrets-welcome-to-the-engraving-station-where-oscar-statuettes-get-personalized/ |archive-date=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ownership of Oscar statuettes ===
Prior to 1950, Oscar statuettes were, and remain, the property of the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Lacey |date=February 28, 2005 |title=Psst!

If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.&lt;ref name=&quot;money.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=How Much Is an Oscar Statue Worth?

In 1989, [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd's]] grandson tried to sell Todd's [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar for his 1956 production of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' to a movie prop collector. The Academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale.

In 1992, [[Harold Russell]] consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' to auction to raise money for his wife's medical expenses. Though his decision caused controversy, the first Oscar ever to be sold passed to a private collector on August 6, 1992, for $60,500 (${{Inflation|US|60500|1992|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). Russell defended his action, saying, &quot;I don't know why anybody would be critical. My wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn't&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rothman |first=Heathcliff |date=February 12, 2006 |title=I'd Really Like to Thank My Pal at the Auction House |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/movies/redcarpet/id-really-like-to-thank-my-pal-at-the-auction-house.html |url-status=live |access-date=September 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921095530/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/movies/redcarpet/id-really-like-to-thank-my-pal-at-the-auction-house.html |archive-date=September 21, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, [[Orson Welles]]' 1941 Oscar for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' ([[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duke |first=Alan |date=December 12, 2011 |title=Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar for sale |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |access-date=December 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112025602/http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |archive-date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542 (${{Inflation|US|861542|2011|r=-2|fmt=c}} today).&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles' Oscar sold&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Duke |first=Alan |date=December 21, 2011 |title=Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar brings $861,000 |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |access-date=April 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116121806/http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |archive-date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Horn |first=John |date=February 19, 2012 |title=Unmasking the Academy |work=Los Angeles Times |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html,0,7473284.htmlstory |access-date=October 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307133844/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html%2C0%2C7473284.htmlstory |archive-date=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Academy launched an initiative to expand its membership and increase diversity.

=== Rules ===
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in [[Los Angeles County, California]], and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify, except for the Best International Feature Film, Best Documentary Feature, and awards in short film categories. The film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run, with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6&amp;nbsp;pm and 10&amp;nbsp;pm local time.&lt;ref name=&quot;92Rule2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Rule Two: Eligibility |url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114205010/https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |archive-date=January 14, 2020 |access-date=March 20, 2020 |website=92nd Academy Awards of Merit: Rules |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oscars Submission FAQ |url=https://submissions.oscars.org/FAQ.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401230002/https://submissions.oscars.org/FAQ.aspx |archive-date=April 1, 2015 |access-date=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] winner, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was originally first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the [[81st Academy Awards|2008 awards]], as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2009 awards]]. Foreign films must include English subtitles. Each country can submit only one film for consideration in the International Feature Film category per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Academy and its Oscar Awards â€“ Reminder List of Eligible Releases |url=http://www.youbioit.com/en/article/shared-information/949/academy-and-its-oscar-awards |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111232741/http://www.youbioit.com/en/article/shared-information/949/academy-and-its-oscar-awards |archive-date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rule 2 states that a film must be [[feature film|feature]]-length, defined as a minimum of 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, except for short-subject awards. It must exist either on a [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print, or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format, with a minimum projector resolution of 2,048 by 1,080 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Academy Award Rules |url=http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/87aa_rules.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021054540/http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/87aa_rules.pdf |archive-date=October 21, 2014 |access-date=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[90th Academy Awards]], presented in 2018, multi-part and limited series have been ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award. This followed the win of ''[[O.J.: Made in America]]'', an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[ESPN]], in that category in [[89th Academy Awards|2017]]. The Academy's announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=McNary |first=Dave |date=April 7, 2017 |title=Oscars: New Rules Bar Multi-Part Documentaries Like 'O.J.: Made in America' |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/oscars-new-rules-documentary-oj-made-in-america-barred-1202026406/ |url-status=live |magazine=Variety |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415012418/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/oscars-new-rules-documentary-oj-made-in-america-barred-1202026406/ |archive-date=April 15, 2017 |access-date=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Best International Feature Film award does not require a U.S. release. It requires the film to be submitted as its country's official selection.

The Best Documentary Feature award requires either week-long releases in ''both'' Los Angeles County ''and'' any of the [[Boroughs of New York City|five boroughs]] of New York City during the previous calendar year,{{efn|Starting with the [[89th Academy Awards|2017 awards]], a qualifying release for the Documentary Feature award can take place anywhere in the [[Boroughs of New York City|five boroughs]] of New York City. Previously, a New York City qualifying run could only take place in [[Manhattan]]. Since then, [[Brooklyn]] has also become a popular location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Awards Rules Approved for 89th OscarsÂ® |date=June 30, 2016 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |url=https://www.oscars.org/news/awards-rules-approved-89th-oscarsr |access-date=April 7, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212337/https://www.oscars.org/news/awards-rules-approved-89th-oscarsr |archive-date=November 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the Documentary Feature Qualifying Festival list, regardless of any public exhibition or distribution, or submission in the International Feature Film category as its country's official selection. The qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non-documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings. A film must have been reviewed by a critic from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time Out New York]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', or ''[[LA Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;92Rule11&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Rule Eleven: Special Rules for the Documentary Awards |url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114205010/https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |archive-date=January 14, 2020 |access-date=March 20, 2020 |website=92nd Academy Awards of Merit: Rules |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline. In case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.

Awards in short film categories (Best Documentary Short Subject, Best Animated Short Film, and Best Live Action Short Film) have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards. First, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead covering one year starting on October 1, and ending on September 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony. Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in ''either'' New York City ''or'' Los Angeles County during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the Academy, also without regard to prior public distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;92Rule11&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;92Rule19&quot;/&gt;

A film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible (Documentary category for that award, and Animation, Narrative, Alternative, or International for the other awards). The requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards. Only one screening per day is required. For the Documentary award, the screening must start between noon and 10&amp;nbsp;pm local time. For other awards, no specific start time is required, but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times.&lt;ref name=&quot;92Rule11&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;92Rule19&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Rule Nineteen: Special Rules for the Short Film Awards |url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114205010/https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |archive-date=January 14, 2020 |access-date=April 7, 2020 |website=92nd Academy Awards of Merit: Rules |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late December, ballots, and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories, i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc. In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees. In all major categories, a variant of the [[single transferable vote]] is used, with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees (ten for Best Picture) ranked preferentially.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheEnvelope&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Pond |first=Steve |date=January 7, 2006 |title=Eight things every voter (and fan) should know about Oscar's decidedly unique nomination process. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/oscars/env-oscarvote7jan07,0,6919642,print.story?coll=env-home-headlines |access-date=January 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017160343/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/oscars/env-oscarvote7jan07%2C0%2C6919642%2Cprint.story?coll=env-home-headlines |archive-date=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Young |first=John |date=January 27, 2011 |title=Oscars: The wacky way the Academy counts votes, and the results of our 'If You Were an Oscar Voter' poll |url=https://ew.com/article/2011/01/27/oscar-voter-ballot-reader-poll-results |url-status=live |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506042043/http://www.ew.com/article/2011/01/27/oscar-voter-ballot-reader-poll-results |archive-date=May 6, 2016 |access-date=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vox&quot; /&gt; In certain categories, including International Feature Film, Documentary and Animated Feature, nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.

Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|marketing to awards voters]] for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in [[Oscar season]]. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marich |first=Robert |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |year=2013 |edition=3rd |pages=235â€“48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner. ''The Hurt Locker'' eventually won.

=== Academy Screening Room ===
The Academy Screening Room or Academy Digital Screening Room is a secure [[List of streaming media services|streaming platform]] which allows voting members of the Academy to view all eligible films (except, initially, those in the International category) in one place. It was introduced in 2019, for the 2020 Oscars. DVD screeners and Academy in-person screenings were still provided. For films to be included on the platform, the North American distributor must pay $12,500, including a [[Digital watermarking|watermarking]] fee, and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the Academy. The platform can be accessed via [[Apple TV]] and [[Roku]] players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Anne |date=2019-10-31 |title=Academy Opens Online 'Screening Room' for Oscar Contenders |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/oscars-2020-academy-screening-room-feature-voting-1202186244/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125013951/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/oscars-2020-academy-screening-room-feature-voting-1202186244/ |archive-date=January 25, 2022 |access-date=2022-01-25 |website=IndieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Urban |first=Sasha |date=2022-03-17 |title=How the Academy's Screening Room Helps Films Find a Global Audience Among Oscar Voters |url=https://variety.com/2022/film/global/academy-screening-room-oscar-voters-1235204906/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220406044133/https://variety.com/2022/film/global/academy-screening-room-oscar-voters-1235204906/ |archive-date=April 6, 2022 |access-date=2022-04-06 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watermarking process involved several video security firms, creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences: How the Academy Awards Shared Films With OscarÂ® Voters With Complete Security |url=https://www.brightcove.com/en/customers/academy-motion-picture-arts-and-sciences/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125013952/https://www.brightcove.com/en/customers/academy-motion-picture-arts-and-sciences/ |archive-date=January 25, 2022 |access-date=2022-01-25 |website=Brightcove}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, for the 2022 Oscars, the Academy banned all physical screeners and in-person screenings, restricting official membership viewing to the Academy Screening Room. Films eligible in the Documentary and International categories were made available in different sections of the platform. Distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadlineScreeningRoom&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Hammond |first=Pete |date=2021-08-27 |title=Oscars: Academy Digital Screening Room Opens With Amazon And Netflix Contenders First To Vie For Voter Attention; DVDs Now Banned |url=https://deadline.com/2021/08/oscars-academy-digital-screening-room-opens-netflix-amazon-1234823367/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125013952/https://deadline.com/2021/08/oscars-academy-digital-screening-room-opens-netflix-amazon-1234823367/ |archive-date=January 25, 2022 |access-date=2022-01-25 |website=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The in-person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Welk |first=Brian |date=2021-08-27 |title=Oscars Academy Postpones All In-Person Events and Screenings Until 2022 |url=https://www.thewrap.com/oscars-academy-postpones-all-in-person-events-and-screenings-until-2022/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125013953/https://www.thewrap.com/oscars-academy-postpones-all-in-person-events-and-screenings-until-2022/ |archive-date=January 25, 2022 |access-date=2022-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligible films do not have to be added to the platform, but the Academy advertises them to voting members when they are.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadlineScreeningRoom&quot;/&gt;

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men. Fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers are sometimes not required to adhere to this. The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.

The Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live from the U.S. to all time zones in North America and worldwide, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 19, 2016 |title=What was the longest Oscars telecast ever? |url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212316/https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |access-date=October 29, 2019 |website=Newsday}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oscars were first televised [[25th Academy Awards|in 1953]] by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until [[32nd Academy Awards|1960]], when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities, including the first color broadcast of the event in [[38th Academy Awards|1966]], to [[42nd Academy Awards|1970]]. NBC regained the rights for five years {{nowrap|(1971â€“75),}} then ABC resumed broadcast duties in [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 31, 2016 |title=ABC Signs Expansive New Agreement to Broadcast The Oscars, Hollywood's Biggest Entertainment Ceremony, Through 2028 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |url=http://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202130914/https://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |archive-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Academy has produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets, especially those outside of the Americas, in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. In 1980, the rights were sold to 60 countries, and by [[56th Academy Awards|1984]], the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.

[[76th Academy Awards|In 2004]], the ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|NCAA division I men's basketball tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. In [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and [[49th Academy Awards|1977]], ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite the national championship game on NBC. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fang |first=Marina |date=June 11, 2019 |title=The Oscars Are Experimenting with a Series Of Date Changes |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212338/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |access-date=October 29, 2019 |website=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March to avoid a clash with the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fang |first=Marina |date=June 11, 2019 |title=The Oscars Are Experimenting with a Series Of Date Changes |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212338/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |access-date=October 29, 2019 |website=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is somewhat restricted, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.

In 2010, the Academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers, as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail. Furthermore, a January ceremony on Sunday would clash with [[National Football League]] playoff games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Horn |first=John |date=October 5, 2010 |title=Academy looks to move 2012 Oscar ceremony up several weeks |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/05/entertainment/la-et-oscars-20101005 |access-date=February 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308124541/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/05/entertainment/la-et-oscars-20101005 |archive-date=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late February to mid-February beginning with the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 5, 2018 |title=Academy Determines New Oscars Category Merits Further Study |url=https://www.oscars.org/news/academy-determines-new-oscars-category-merits-further-study |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114100723/https://oscars.org/news/academy-determines-new-oscars-category-merits-further-study |archive-date=January 14, 2019 |access-date=January 15, 2019 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |quote=The Board of Governors also voted to move up the date of the 92nd Oscars telecast to Sunday, February 9, 2020, from the previously announced February 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2024, the ceremony was moved to an even earlier start time of 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm PT/7:00&amp;nbsp;pm ET, the apparent impetus being the ability for ABC to air a half-hour of primetime programming as a lead-out program at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm PT/10:30&amp;nbsp;pm ET &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hammond |first1=Pete |last2=Hipes |first2=Patrick |date=November 30, 2023 |title=Oscars 2024 Ceremony Moves Up Start Time by an Hour; ''Abbott Elementary'' to Follow Telecast on ABC |url=https://deadline.com/2023/11/oscars-2024-start-time-moved-abc-1235644551/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231130181158/https://deadline.com/2023/11/oscars-2024-start-time-moved-abc-1235644551/ |archive-date=November 30, 2023 |access-date=November 30, 2023 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a &quot;[[popularity contest]]&quot; feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact. The applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead. This segment was later followed by a commercial break.

In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15&amp;nbsp;minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Ehbar, Ned (February 28, 2014). &quot;Did you know?&quot; ''Metro''.

Although still dominant in ratings, the viewership of the Academy Awards has steadily dropped. The [[88th Academy Awards]] were the lowest-rated in the past eight years (although with increases in male and 18â€“49 viewership), while the show itself also faced mixed reception. Following the show, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself. Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety-struggleabc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=March 2016 |title=ABC's Oscar Contract Renegotiations: Who'll Get Creative Control? |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-academy-oscars-deal-renegotiations-oscars-2016-1201718452/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302000335/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-academy-oscars-deal-renegotiations-oscars-2016-1201718452/ |archive-date=March 2, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016 |website=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC to 2028: the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety-2028&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=September 2016 |title=Inside the Oscars Deal: What it Means for ABC and the Academy |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-oscars-deal-status-quo-1201849487/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901184910/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-oscars-deal-status-quo-1201849487/ |archive-date=September 1, 2016 |access-date=September 2, 2016 |website=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in downtown Los Angeles.

[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The [[21st Academy Awards]] in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what had been the Academy's headquarters on [[Melrose Avenue]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oscars Award Venues |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/venues.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212063803/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/venues.html |archive-date=December 12, 2006 |access-date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]]. With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the [[Majestic Theatre (Columbus Circle)|NBC International Theatre]] (1953) and then at the [[New Century Theatre|NBC Century Theatre]], after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. In 1961, the Oscars moved to the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], California. In 1969, the Academy moved the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles, to the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] at the [[Los Angeles Music Center|Los Angeles County Music Center]]. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the ceremony returned to the Shrine Auditorium.

In 2002, Hollywood's [[Dolby Theatre]], previously known as the Kodak Theatre, became the presentation's current venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oscars' home renamed Dolby Theatre |publisher=[[CBS News]] |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/ |url-status=dead |access-date=May 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502081049/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/ |archive-date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories, Drama and Comedy. At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories, Drama and Comedy/Musical. From the 1930s to the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.

In August 2018, the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oscars Won't Televise All Awards, Adds Popular Film Category |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-plans-three-hour-oscars-telecast-adds-popular-film-category-1133138 |url-status=live |access-date=August 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103125108/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-plans-three-hour-oscars-telecast-adds-popular-film-category-1133138 |archive-date=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following dissent from Academy members, they announced that they would air all 24 categories live. This followed several proposals, among them, the introduction of a Popular Film category, that the Academy had announced but did not implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Academy Reverses Decision, Will Air All Awards at the 2019 Oscars |magazine=Time |url=http://time.com/5531252/air-all-awards-oscars-2019/ |url-status=dead |access-date=February 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217185917/http://time.com/5531252/air-all-awards-oscars-2019/ |archive-date=February 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current special categories ===
* [[Academy Honorary Award]]: since 1929
* [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award]] (three different awards): since 1931
* [[Gordon E. Sawyer Award]]: since 1981

=== Discontinued special categories ===
* [[Academy Juvenile Award]]: 1934 to 1960

== Criticism and controversies ==
=== Accusations of commercialism ===
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, many studios spend around 25 million dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the &quot;[[Oscar season]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2024-03-10 |title=Comment l'Ã©quipe d'Â« Anatomie d'une chute Â» a menÃ© sa campagne dans le marathon pour les Oscars |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2024/03/10/dans-le-marathon-pour-les-oscars-anatomie-d-une-chute-tente-de-se-frayer-un-couloir_6221137_3246.html |access-date=2024-03-11 |work=Le Monde.fr |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing and [[lobbying]] than by quality. [[William Friedkin]], an Academy Awardâ€“winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as &quot;the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |title=Director William Friedkin at the Hudson Union Society |date=February 24, 2009 |access-date=March 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310081013/http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |archive-date=March 10, 2009 |people=Friedkin, William (Director)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Dirks, editor of [[American Movie Classics|AMC]]'s [[Filmsite]], has written of the Academy Awards:

{{blockquote|Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 1980s, moneymaking &quot;formula-made&quot; blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven't necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Academy Awards â€“ The Oscars |url=http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120093333/http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |archive-date=January 20, 2014 |access-date=October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}A recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the [[whisper campaign]]. These campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those who were involved in creating the movie. Examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'' suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'' distorts history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kilday |first=Gregg |date=December 20, 2012 |title=Oscar's Dirty Tricks: Inside the Whisper Campaign Machine (Analysis) |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-dirty-tricks-inside-whisper-405693 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043347/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-dirty-tricks-inside-whisper-405693 |archive-date=March 6, 2019 |access-date=March 2, 2019 |website=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of bias ===
{{further|Oscar bait}}

Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. in the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. The term &quot;[[Oscar bait]]&quot; was coined to describe such movies. This has led, at times, to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring &quot;Oscar bait&quot; over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Kyle |title=Have the Oscars jumped the shark? |work=New York Post |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |access-date=January 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115808/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |archive-date=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the success of ''[[The Dark Knight]]'', the film did not receive a [[Best Picture]] nomination at the [[81st Academy Awards]]. This decision received substantial criticism and was described as a &quot;snub&quot; by many publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Child |first=Ben |date=2009-01-28 |title=The week in geek: The Dark Knight's Oscars snub is a disgrace |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/jan/28/oscars-sciencefictionandfantasy |access-date=2023-12-01 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Wallace |first=Lewis |title=Why So Serious?

=== Miscategorization of actors ===
{{See also|Carol (film)#Oscar category}}

The Academy has no rules for how to categorize whether a performance is leading or supporting, and it is up to the discretion of the studios whether a given performance is submitted for either Best Actor/Actress or Best Supporting Actor/Actress. This has led to situations where a film has two or more co-leads, and one of these is submitted in a supporting category to avoid the two leads competing against each other, and to increase the film's chances of winning. This practice has been derisively called &quot;category fraud&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.liveabout.com/difference-between-lead-and-supporting-actor-2428097 | title=How Lead and Supporting Actor Oscars Are Determined | access-date=March 17, 2023 | archive-date=December 9, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221209195446/https://www.liveabout.com/difference-between-lead-and-supporting-actor-2428097 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.polygon.com/22399802/oscars-category-controversy | title=The Oscars need to fix the Supporting Actor category | website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date=April 25, 2021 | access-date=March 17, 2023 | archive-date=October 21, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221021002529/https://www.polygon.com/22399802/oscars-category-controversy | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Rooney Mara]] was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for ''[[Carol (film)|Carol]]'' (2015), despite her having a comparable amount of screentime to [[Cate Blanchett]], who was nominated for Best Actress. Another example is ''[[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood]]'' (2019), where [[Brad Pitt]] was nominated for and won Best Supporting Actor, even though he played an equally important role to Best Actor nominee [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. In both these cases, critics argued that [[The Weinstein Company]], the studio behind the former film, had placed someone who was actually a leading actor or actress into the supporting categories to avoid them competing against their co-lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.liveabout.com/difference-between-lead-and-supporting-actor-2428097 | title=How Lead and Supporting Actor Oscars Are Determined | access-date=March 17, 2023 | archive-date=December 9, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221209195446/https://www.liveabout.com/difference-between-lead-and-supporting-actor-2428097 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.polygon.com/22399802/oscars-category-controversy | title=The Oscars need to fix the Supporting Actor category | website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date=April 25, 2021 | access-date=March 17, 2023 | archive-date=October 21, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221021002529/https://www.polygon.com/22399802/oscars-category-controversy | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbolism or sentimentalization ===
Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://incontention.com/?p=1045 |title=What's the worst Best Actor choice of all time? |access-date=October 4, 2009 |archive-date=January 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20100115115957/http://incontention.com/?p=1045 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make up for a &quot;snub&quot; for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded, or presented as a &quot;career honor&quot; to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;levy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Emanuel |title=All About Oscar: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8264-1452-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recognition of streaming media film ===
Following the [[91st Academy Awards]] in February 2019 in which the [[Netflix]]-broadcast film ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category, Steven Spielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services. Spielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than for typical Oscar-winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than for other Best Picture-nominated films, while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical-run status to qualify for an Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-oscar-academy-wars-1202047846/ |title=The Spielberg vs. Netflix Battle Could Mean Collateral Damage for Indies at the Oscars |first=Anna |last=Thompson |date=February 28, 2019 |access-date=April 24, 2019 |work=[[IndieWire]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320081430/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-oscar-academy-wars-1202047846/ |archive-date=March 20, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice]], having heard of this potential rule change, wrote a letter to the Academy in March 2019, cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti-trust concerns against the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/doj-oscar-rules-changes-netflix-1203178413/ |title=Justice Department Warns Academy Over Potential Oscar Rule Changes Threatening Netflix |first=Ted |last=Johnson |date=April 2, 2019 |access-date=April 24, 2019 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423210652/https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/doj-oscar-rules-changes-netflix-1203178413/ |archive-date=April 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its April 2019 board meeting, the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/entertainment/academy-streaming-oscars/index.html |title=Academy doesn't change streaming eligibility for Oscars |first=Lisa |last=Respers France |date=April 24, 2019 |access-date=April 24, 2019 |publisher=[[CNN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424125530/https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/entertainment/academy-streaming-oscars/index.html |archive-date=April 24, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refusals of the award ===
Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was screenwriter [[Dudley Nichols]] (Best Writing in 1935 for ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]''). Nichols boycotted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild.&lt;ref name=&quot;DYK&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |title=The Oscars Did You Know? |access-date=June 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000022/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |archive-date=June 23, 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later, at the 1938 ceremony. Nichols was nominated for three further Academy Awards during his career.

[[George C. Scott]] became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'') at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] ceremony. Scott described it as a &quot;meat parade&quot;, saying, &quot;I don't want any part of it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm |work=BBC News |title=George C Scott: The man who refused an Oscar |date=September 23, 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311095900/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm |archive-date=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html |magazine=Time |title=Show Business: Meat Parade |date=March 8, 1971 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221203341/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C904789%2C00.html |archive-date=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |title=Fast Facts â€“ Did You Know? |publisher=Biography.com |date=May 16, 1929 |access-date=February 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210075430/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |archive-date=February 10, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third person to refuse the award was [[Marlon Brando]], who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972's ''[[The Godfather]]''), citing the film industry's discrimination against and mistreatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. At the [[45th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Brando asked actress and [[civil rights activist]] [[Sacheen Littlefeather]] to read a 15-page speech in his place, detailing his criticisms, for which there was [[booing]] and [[cheering]] by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oscars |title=Marlon Brando's Oscar win for &quot; The Godfather&quot; |date=October 2, 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUacU0I4yU |access-date=February 25, 2019 |via=YouTube |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217152537/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUacU0I4yU |archive-date=February 17, 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DYK&quot;/&gt; In 2022, Littlefeather was accused by her sisters of misrepresenting her ancestry as Native American.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |date=2022-10-22 |title=Sacheen Littlefeather Lied About Native American Ancestry, Sisters Claim |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/sacheen-littlefeather-native-american-ancestry-1234616464/ |access-date=2023-03-12 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US |archive-date=October 23, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221023002533/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/sacheen-littlefeather-native-american-ancestry-1234616464/ |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2022-10-22 |title=Sacheen Littlefeather's sisters say her Native identity was fraudulent |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Sacheen-Littlefeather-oscar-Native-pretendian-17520648.php |access-date=2023-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221022111100/https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Sacheen-Littlefeather-oscar-Native-pretendian-17520648.php |archive-date=October 22, 2022 |last1=Keeler |first1=Jacqueline }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Travis |first1=Emlyn |date=October 22, 2022 |title=Sacheen Littlefeather, Native American activist who protested the Oscars, was a 'fraud,' sisters say |url=https://ew.com/movies/sacheen-littlefeather-native-american-oscars-protester-fraud-sisters-say/ |access-date=2023-03-12 |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |language=en |archive-date=January 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230114223534/https://ew.com/movies/sacheen-littlefeather-native-american-oscars-protester-fraud-sisters-say/ |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sacheen Littlefather's sisters say she was not Native American.

=== Disqualifications ===
Seven films have had nominations revoked before the official award ceremony:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/73722/8-oscar-nominations-were-revoked |title=9 Oscar Nominations That Were Revoked |last=Obias |first=Rudie |publisher=Mental Floss |date=February 23, 2019 |access-date=October 14, 2019 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212356/https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/73722/8-oscar-nominations-were-revoked |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Circus (1928 film)|The Circus]]'' (1928) â€“ The film was voluntarily removed by the Academy from competitive categories, to award [[Charlie Chaplin]] a special award.
* ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' (1953) â€“ Removed from the Best Story ballot after letters from the producer and nominee questioned its inclusion in the category.
* ''[[High Society (1955 film)|High Society]]'' (1955) â€“ Withdrawn from screenwriting ballot after being mistaken for the [[High Society (1956 film)|1956 movie]] of the same title.
* ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) â€“ Initially nominated for eleven awards, its nomination for Best Original Score was revoked after it was discovered that its main theme was very similar to music that [[Nino Rota|the score's composer]] had written for an earlier film. None of its other nominations were revoked, and it received three Oscars, including Best Picture.
* ''[[A Place in the World (film)|A Place in the World]]'' (1992) â€“ Removed from the Best Foreign Language Film ballot after it was discovered that the country which submitted the film exercised insufficient artistic control.
* ''[[Alone Yet Not Alone]]'' (2014) â€“ The film's title song, &quot;Alone Yet Not Alone&quot;, was removed from the Best Original Song ballot after [[Bruce Broughton]] was found to have improperly contacted other members of the Academy's musical branch; this was the first time that a film was removed from a ballot for ethical reasons.
* ''[[13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi]]'' (2017) â€“ Sound mixer [[Greg P. Russell]]'s nomination was rescinded one day before the Awards when it was discovered he had improperly contacted voters by telephone. In this case, the nominations for the other three nominated sound mixers, [[Gary Summers]], [[Jeffrey J. Haboush]] and [[Mac Ruth]], were allowed to stand.

One film was disqualified after winning the award, and had the winner return the Oscar:
* ''[[Young Americans (1967 film)|Young Americans]]'' (1969) â€“ Initially won the award for Best Documentary Feature, but was later revoked after it was revealed that it had opened theatrically prior to the eligibility period.

One film had its nomination revoked after the award ceremony when it had not won the Oscar:
* ''[[Tuba Atlantic]]'' (2011) â€“ Its nomination for Best Live Action Short Film was revoked when it was discovered that the film had aired on television in 2010, before its theatrical release.

=== Remarks about animated films as children's genre ===
At the [[94th Academy Awards]] in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed Disney princess characters in [[List of Disney live-action adaptations and remakes of Disney animated films|live-action remakes]] of their respective animated films: [[Lily James]] (''[[Cinderella (2015 American film)|Cinderella]]''), [[Naomi Scott]] (''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]''), and [[Halle Bailey]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (2023 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''{{--)}}. While introducing the category, Bailey stated that animated films are &quot;formative experiences as kids who watch them,&quot; as James put it, &quot;So many kids watch these movies over and over, over and over again.&quot; Scott added: &quot;I see some parents who know exactly what we're talking about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rmiq2PPQDg|title='Encanto' Wins Best Animated Feature Film &amp;#124; 94th Oscars|date=April 28, 2022|publisher=Oscars|type=Award show|via=YouTube |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230509140640/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rmiq2PPQDg |archive-date= May 9, 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks were heavily criticized by animation fans and those working in the animation industry as infantilizing the medium and perpetuating the stigma that animated works are [[Children's film|strictly for children]], especially since the industry was credited with sustaining the flow of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] content and revenue during the height of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Phil Lord]], co-producer of one of the nominated films, ''[[The Mitchells vs. the Machines]]'', tweeted that it was &quot;super cool to position animation as something that kids watch and adults have to endure.&quot; The film's official social media accounts responded to the joke with an image reading: &quot;Animation is cinema.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fuster |first=Jeremy |date=March 27, 2022 |title=Phil Lord and Hollywood's Animators Slam Oscars for 'Belittling' Animation Categories |url=https://www.thewrap.com/oscars-new-deal-for-animation/ |access-date=March 29, 2022 |work=[[TheWrap]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=1508481868479361026|user=MitchellsMovie|title=*taps sign*}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Lord and his producing partner [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Christopher Miller]] wrote a guest column in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' criticizing the Academy for the joke and how Hollywood has treated animation, writing that &quot;no one set out to diminish animated films, but it's high time we set out to elevate them.&quot; They also suggested to the Academy that the category should be presented by a filmmaker who respects the art of animation as cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lord |first1=Phil |last2=Miller |first2=Chris |date=April 6, 2022 |title=Phil Lord and Chris Miller: Hollywood Should Elevate, Not Diminish Animation (Guest Column) |url=https://variety.com/2022/film/news/phil-lord-christopher-miller-animation-oscars-1235225442/ |access-date=April 6, 2022 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to the controversy was that the award for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]] (the nominees for which were mostly made up of shorts not aimed at children) was one of the [[94th Academy Awards#Effort to shorten the ceremony|eight categories]] that were not presented during the live broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=March 27, 2022 |title=During The Biggest Oscar Trainwreck In History, 'Encanto' And 'The Windshield Wiper' Won Oscars (Commentary) |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/during-the-biggest-oscar-trainwreck-in-history-encanto-and-the-windshield-wiper-won-oscars-commentary-214531.html |access-date=March 29, 2022 |publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner for the Best Animated Short award was ''[[The Windshield Wiper]]'', a multilingual Spanish-American film which is [[Adult animation|adult animated]], while another nominee in three categories: Best Animated Feature, [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film|Best Documentary Feature Film]], and [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]], was ''[[Flee (film)|Flee]]'', a PG-13 rated animated documentary about an Afghan refugee. [[Alberto Mielgo]], director of ''The Windshield Wiper'', later gave an acceptance speech for the Oscar: &quot;Animation is an art that includes every single art that you can imagine. Animation for adults is a fact. It's happening. Let's call it cinema. I'm very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=March 28, 2022 |title=During The Biggest Oscar Trainwreck In History, 'Encanto' And 'The Windshield Wiper' Won Oscars (Commentary) |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/during-the-biggest-oscar-trainwreck-in-history-encanto-and-the-windshield-wiper-won-oscars-commentary-214531.html |access-date=April 22, 2022 |website=Cartoon Brew |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision not to broadcast the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=March 28, 2022 |title=Wake Up, Oscars: Animation isn't just for kids |url=https://mashable.com/article/animation-oscars-2022-joke-phil-lord |website=Mashable |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor is that numerous animated films have been made for mature audiences or with ranges of PG-13 or more, with a few of them â€”''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'', ''[[Persepolis (film)|Persepolis]]'', ''[[Chico and Rita]]'', ''[[The Wind Rises]]'', ''[[Anomalisa]]'', ''[[My Life as a Courgette]]'', ''[[The Breadwinner (film)|The Breadwinner]]'', ''[[Loving Vincent]]'', ''[[Isle of Dogs (film)|Isle of Dogs]]'', ''[[I Lost My Body]]'', and ''[[Flee (film)|Flee]]''â€” having been nominated in this category, with ''[[The Boy and the Heron]]'' being the first adult animated film (in this case, PG-13-rated) to win in the [[96th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Edwards |first=Belen |date=March 28, 2022 |title=Wake Up, Oscars: Animation isn't just for kids |url=https://mashable.com/article/animation-oscars-2022-joke-phil-lord |access-date=April 18, 2022 |website=Mashable |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Amini |first=Amid |date=2024-03-10 |title='Boy And The Heron' Is The First Hand-Drawn Animated Feature To Win Oscar In 21 Years |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/awards/boy-and-the-heron-is-the-first-hand-drawn-animated-feature-to-win-oscar-in-21-years-238916.html |access-date=2024-03-11 |website=Cartoon Brew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These comments came as ''#NewDeal4Animation'', a movement of animation workers demanding equal pay, treatment and recognition alongside their contemporaries working in live-action, was picking up momentum during negotiations for a new contract between [[The Animation Guild, IATSE Local 839]]/[[SAG-AFTRA]] and the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Robb |first=David |date=March 29, 2022 |title=Contract Talks Coming Down To The Wire For SAG-AFTRA &amp; The Animation Guild |url=https://deadline.com/2022/03/contract-talks-sag-aftra-animation-guild-1234990317/ |access-date=March 30, 2022 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the presentation is being used to rally the movement.

During the [[96th Academy Awards]] in 2024, host [[Jimmy Kimmel]] said, &quot;Please raise your hand if you let your kid fill out this part of the ballot.&quot; These remarks would again prompt backlash, with [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Christopher Miller]], producer of that year's nominated ''[[Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse]]'', tweeting out that the joke was &quot;tired and lazy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=March 11, 2024 |title=Christopher Miller on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/chrizmillr/status/1767061360142331933 |website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PG-13-rated ''The Boy and the Heron'' would subsequently win the award.

It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars.

The film had first screened at the same location in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=THomas|first1=Kevin|title=Sometimes, the World Gets in the Way|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/01/entertainment/ca-31570|lang=en|access-date=2015-12-21|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2001-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221084433/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/01/entertainment/ca-31570|archive-date=2012-12-21|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown at the 1997 [[Stockholm International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=SFF /&gt;

=== Reception ===
In ''Movie - Film - Review'', Christopher Tookey wrote that though the actresses were &quot;competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers&quot;, the film &quot;is visually unimaginative, never escapes its stage origins, and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tookey/&gt; Noting that there were &quot;occasional, refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness&quot;, they did not &quot;justify comparisons to ''[[All About Eve]]''&quot;, and were &quot;insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with ''[[Rashomon]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tookey/&gt; He also wrote that ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the film a &quot;slow, stuffy chamber-piece&quot;, and that ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' stated the film's &quot;best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesome's composed veneers&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tookey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tookey|first1=Chris|title=review: Actresses / Actrius / Actrices|url=http://www.movie-film-review.com/devFilm.asp?ID=12423|lang=en|publisher=Movie - Film - Review|access-date=2015-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501211137/http://www.movie-film-review.com/devFilm.asp?ID=12423|archive-date=2012-05-01|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MRQE]] wrote &quot;This cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original, but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story.&quot;&lt;ref name=MRQE&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff|title=Actrius (1997)|url=http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/actrius-m100030469|lang=en|publisher=[[MRQE]]|access-date=2015-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222150358/http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/actrius-m100030469|archive-date=2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Animalia'' is an [[alliteration|alliterative]] [[alphabet]] book and contains twenty-six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet. Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for [[alligator]] and [[armadillo]], B is for [[butterfly]], etc.) along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words. The illustrations contain many other objects beginning with that letter that the reader can try to identify (however, there are not necessarily &quot;a thousand things, or maybe more&quot;, as the author states). As an additional challenge, the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture.

'''International Atomic Time''' (abbreviated '''TAI''', from its French name '''{{lang|fr|temps atomique international}}'''&lt;ref&gt;Temps atomique 1975{{elucidate|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a high-precision [[Atomic clock|atomic]] [[coordinate time|coordinate]] [[time standard]] based on the notional passage of [[proper time]] on Earth's [[geoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the International Atomic Time TAI a coordinate time or a proper time?|journal=Celestial Mechanics|volume=38|issue=2|pages=155â€“161 |bibcode=1986CeMec..38..155G|last1=Guinot|first1=B.|year=1986|doi=10.1007/BF01230427|s2cid=120564915}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAI is a [[weighted average]] of the time kept by over 450 [[atomic clock]]s in over 80 national laboratories worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time n.d.&quot; /&gt; It is a continuous scale of time, without [[leap seconds]], and it is the principal realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (with a fixed offset of [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]). It is the basis for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface and which has leap seconds.

UTC deviates from TAI by a number of whole seconds. {{as of|2017|01|01}}, when another [[leap second]] was put into effect,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin C 52&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/bul/bulc/bulletinc.52|first=Christian|last=Bizouard|title=Bulletin C 52|lang=en|publisher=[[IERS]]|location=Paris|date=6 July 2016|access-date=31 December 2016|archive-date=13 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813224025/https://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/bul/bulc/bulletinc.52|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; UTC is currently exactly 37 seconds behind TAI. The 37 seconds result from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 27 leap seconds in UTC since 1972.

TAI may be reported using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both [[Julian day]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due primarily to the slowing rotation of the Earth.

== Operation ==
TAI is a [[weighted average]] of the time kept by over 450 [[atomic clock]]s in over 80 national laboratories worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time n.d.&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The participating institutions each broadcast, in [[real-time data|real time]], a frequency signal with [[timecode]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''UTC(NPL)'' in the UTC form, where ''NPL'' here identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]]. The TAI form may be denoted ''TAI(NPL)''.  The latter is not to be confused with ''TA(NPL)'', which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.

The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time n.d.&quot;/&gt;  This combined time scale is published monthly in &quot;Circular T&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Circular T |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] |url=https://www.bipm.org/en/time-ftp/circular-t |access-date=16 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the [[canonical form|canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC âˆ’ UTC(''k'') (equal to TAI âˆ’ TAI(''k'')) for each participating institution ''k''.  The same circular also gives tables of TAI âˆ’ TA(''k''), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.

Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T, the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight, it is possible to discover errors in TAI and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Since the published circulars are definitive, better estimates do not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).

== History ==
Early atomic time scales consisted of [[quartz clock]]s with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL)]]. It was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] and to establish a time scale, called Greenwich Atomic (GA). The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 scale on 13 September 1956, using an [[Atomichron]] commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the [[National Bureau of Standards]], [[Boulder, Colorado]] on 9 October 1957.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=199â€“200}}

The [[International Time Bureau]] (BIH) began a time scale, T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of [[VLF]] radio signals. The BIH scale, A.1, and NBS-A were defined by an [[Epoch (date reference)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958{{efn|They were set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant. However, each observatory used its own value of UT2.{{sfn|Guinot|2000|page=181}}}} The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: ''A3'' in 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Steve |title=The epoch of TAI is 1961-01-01T20:00:00 UT2 |url=https://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/taiepoch.html |publisher=UCO/Lick Observatory |quote=By 1964 BIH realized that some atomic chronometers were much better than others, and they constructed A3 based on the best 3 |lang=en|access-date=21 January 2019|archive-date=10 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211010014537/https://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/taiepoch.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''TA(BIH)'' in 1969.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=200â€“201}}

The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967. From 1971 to 1975 the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] made a series of decisions that designated the BIPM time scale International Atomic Time (TAI).{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=203â€“204}}

In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale, therefore, corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks. Starting from the Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00 TAI), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at the [[geoid]] ([[mean sea level]]).  Because the clocks were, on average, well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed by about one part in a trillion. The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name ''EAL'' (''Ã‰chelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=215}}

The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brumberg|first1=V.A.|last2=Kopeikin|first2=S.M.|title=Relativistic time scales in the solar system|journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy]]|issn=0923-2958|volume=48|issue=1|pages=23â€“44|date=March 1990|doi=10.1007/BF00050674|bibcode=1990CeMDA..48...23B|s2cid=120112678}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.{{efn|The 32.184 second offset is to provide continuity with the older [[ephemeris time]].}} TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184&amp;nbsp;s.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=218&amp;ndash;219}}

The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated, &quot;In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Relation to UTC ==
Contrary to TAI, UTC is a [[discontinuous]] time scale. It is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds. Between these adjustments, it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time by a constant offset. From its beginning in 1961 through December 1971, the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated [[UT2]].  Afterward, these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate [[UT1]]. This was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale. The less frequent whole-second adjustments meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally. The fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=227&amp;ndash;229}}

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|Giving [[alms]] to the poor is often considered an altruistic action.]]

'''Altruism''' is the [[moral principle|principle]] and [[moral behavior|practice]] of concern for the [[well-being]] and/or [[happiness]] of other [[human]]s or animals above oneself. While objects of altruistic concern vary, it is an important moral value in many [[Culture|cultures]] and [[Religion|religions]]. It may be considered a synonym of selflessness, the opposite of [[selfishness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kraut |first=Richard |title=Altruism |date=2020 |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2020/entries/altruism/ |access-date=2024-05-05 |edition=Fall 2020 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''altruism'' was popularized (and possibly coined) by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as {{lang|fr|altruisme}}, for an [[antonym]] of [[egoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref2

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from the Italian {{lang|it|altrui}}, which in turn was derived from Latin {{lang|la|alteri}}, meaning &quot;[[alterity|other people]]&quot; or &quot;somebody else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ciciloni|first=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/agrammaritalian00cicigoog/page/n81 64]|url=https://archive.org/details/agrammaritalian00cicigoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism, as observed in populations of organisms, is when an individual performs an action at a cost to itself (in terms of e.g. pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction) that benefits, directly or indirectly, another individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Okasha |first=Samir |title=Biological Altruism |date=2020 |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2020/entries/altruism-biological/ |access-date=2024-05-05 |edition=Summer 2020 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]] or concern for the [[common good]]. The latter are predicated upon social relationships, whilst altruism does not consider relationships. Whether &quot;true&quot; altruism is possible in human psychology is a subject of debate. The theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of [[sharing]], [[Helping behavior|helping]], or [[Self-sacrifice|sacrificing]] can be truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. The validity of this argument depends on whether such [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as &quot;benefits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=May |first=Joshua |title=Altruism and Psychological Egoism |url=https://philpapers.org/browse/altruism-and-psychological-egoism |website=PhilPapers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ENVS203: Altruism |url=https://learn.saylor.org/mod/page/view.php?id=8333 |access-date=2024-05-05 |website=Saylor Academy |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]'' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Low |first1=Kim Cheng Patrick |title=Altruistic CSR |date=2013 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Corporate Social Responsibility |pages=81â€“91 |editor-last=Idowu |editor-first=Samuel O. |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-28036-8_186 |access-date=2024-05-05 |place=Berlin, Heidelberg |publisher=Springer |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28036-8_186 |isbn=978-3-642-28036-8 |last2=Ang |first2=Sik-Liong |editor2-last=Capaldi |editor2-first=Nicholas |editor3-last=Zu |editor3-first=Liangrong |editor4-last=Gupta |editor4-first=Ananda Das}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The notion of altruism==
The concept of altruism has a history in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] thought. The term was coined in the 19th century by the founding [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher of science]] [[Auguste Comte]], and has become a major topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them, above oneself.

===Anthropology===
{{expand section|date=July 2023}}
{{See also|Alms|Altruism (ethics)}}
[[Marcel Mauss]]'s essay ''[[The Gift (essay)|The Gift]]'' contains a passage called &quot;Note on alms&quot;. This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:

{{blockquote|Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.}}

===Evolutionary explanations===

[[File:Manner of Francis Wheatley, Giving alms to beggar children.jpg|thumb|upright|Giving alms to beggar children]]
In the Science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[Sociocultural evolution|social evolution]], altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: the mechanism of evolution| url = https://archive.org/details/selectionmechani00bell_664| url-access = limited| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 978-0-19-856972-5| pages = [https://archive.org/details/selectionmechani00bell_664/page/n381 367]â€“368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[evolutionary psychology]] this term may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as [[Charity (practice)|charity]], [[emergency aid]], help to coalition partners, [[Gratuity|tipping]], [[courtship]] gifts, production of [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s, and [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AEP1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | first=Pat|last=Barcaly| chapter=The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation|editor-last1 = Roberts | editor-first1 = S.

Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were {{clarify|text=accelerated|reason=what does it mean for a theory to accelerate? How does a need accelerate a theory?|date=July 2023}} by the need to produce ideas compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and [[evolutionary game theory]]: a mathematical model and analysis of behavioral strategies.

Some of the proposed mechanisms are: 
* [[Kin selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Biological Altruism|chapter=Kin Selection and Inclusive Fitness|chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/#KinSelIncFit|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Okasha|first=Samir|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures. Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs to resemble the faces of study participants more closely increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, which has been found to increase helpful behavior. Another study found more cooperative behavior, the greater the number of perceived kin in a group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study. This effect was powerful for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* Vested interests. People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies and those from similar social [[ingroup]]s suffer or disappear. Helping such group members may, therefore, also benefit the altruist. Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness. Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] threatens the entire ingroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trivers |first1=Robert L. |title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |date=March 1971 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=35â€“57 |doi=10.1086/406755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Reciprocity (evolution)]].
** Direct [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.7466396 |first1=R|last1=Axelrod|first2=W.D.|last2=Hamilton |title=The evolution of cooperation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=211 |issue=4489 |date=27 March 1981 |pages=1390â€“1396 |pmid=7466396 |bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A|citeseerx=10.1.1.147.9644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they will reciprocate the help. The effective [[tit for tat]] strategy is one [[game theory|game theoretic]] example. Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:One consequence is that people are more cooperative with one another if they are more likely to interact again in the future. People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower. They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others, and this effect tends to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors. Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness, such as calling it a &quot;Community Game&quot; instead of a &quot;Wall Street Game&quot;.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize, so people become more helpful toward others after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better cooperativeness assessments or promises exchange. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger-scale competitions, such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner. It may also signal interactive and cooperative intentions, since someone who does not expect to interact further in the future gains nothing from such costly signaling. While it's uncertain if costly signaling can predict long-term cooperative traits, people tend to trust helpers more. Costly signaling loses its value when everyone shares identical traits, resources, and cooperative intentions, but it gains significance as population variability in these aspects increases.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Hunters who [[Sharing|share]] meat display a costly signal of ability. The research found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else. Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations are ways of demonstrating one's resources. [[Hero|Heroic]] risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on reputation value and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helpful when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, publicly announced, discussed, or observed by someone else. This has been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues, such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. {{dubious|reason=failed to replicate: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8494318/|date=July 2023}} Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt; Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as generous.

:Typically, women find altruistic men to be attractive partners. When women look for a long-term partner, altruism may be a trait they prefer as it may indicate that the prospective partner is also willing to [[Sharing|share]] resources with her and her children. Men perform charitable acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner, there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in the presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships, which may be because they expect less success.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AEP2/&gt;

:People may compete for the social benefit of a burnished reputation, which may cause [[competitive altruism]]. On the other hand, in some experiments, a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and do not help more, even if this is conspicuous. This may be due to reasons such as [[psychopathy]] or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen as altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future compared to the immediate costs of altruism. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others, and these people tend to be less cooperative.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Explicit [[extrinsic]] rewards and punishments have sometimes been found to have a counterintuitively inverse effect on behaviors when compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which may make the thus-incentivized behaviors less desirable. People prefer altruism in others when it appears to be due to a personality characteristic rather than overt reputational concerns; simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of action may reduce them. This may be used as a derogatory tactic against altruists (&quot;you're just [[virtue signalling]]&quot;), especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Group selection]]. It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as [[David Sloan Wilson]] that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group, even if these adaptations are detrimental at the individual level. Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory, the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while directing prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (see also [[in-group favoritism]]). Many other evolutionary scientists have criticized group selection theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Leon|last=Neyfakh|newspaper=Boston Globe|title=Where does good come from?|date=17 April 2011|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/04/17/where_does_good_come_from/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719030530/http://articles.boston.com/2011-04-17/bostonglobe/29428429_1_altruism-mole-rats-evolutionary-theory|archive-date=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such explanations do not imply that humans consciously calculate how to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] when doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote certain altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The benefits for the altruist may be increased, and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than competitors, and to members in-groups than to members of out-groups.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]], a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides''. These protists live as individual [[amoeba]]e until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hudson |first1=Richard Ellis |last2=Aukema |first2=Juliann Eve |last3=Rispe |first3=Claude |last4=Roze |first4=Denis |title=Altruism, Cheating, and Anticheater Adaptations in Cellular Slime Molds |journal=The American Naturalist |date=July 2002 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=31â€“43 |doi=10.1086/340613 |pmid=18707497 |url=https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-02683365/file/2002_Hudson%20et%20al._Am%20Nat_1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Stephanie L. |last2=Brown |first2=R.

Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics, for example, by the Russian [[Zoology|zoologist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' and [[Ethics|Moral Philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]] in his book ''[[A Darwinian Left]]''.

Bill Harbaugh, a [[University of Oregon]] economist, in an fMRI scanner test conducted with his psychologist colleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr, reached the same conclusions as Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity, although they were able to divide the study group into two groups: &quot;egoists&quot; and &quot;altruists&quot;. One of their discoveries was that, though rarely, even some of the considered &quot;egoists&quot; sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others, leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in charity, such as a person's environment and values.&lt;ref name=&quot;neurons&quot;/&gt;

A recent meta-analysis of fMRI studies conducted by Shawn Rhoads, Jo Cutler, and Abigail Marsh analyzed the results of prior studies of generosity in which participants could freely choose to give or not give resources to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rhoads |first1=Shawn A |last2=Cutler |first2=Jo |last3=Marsh |first3=Abigail A |title=A feature-based network analysis and fMRI meta-analysis reveal three distinct types of prosocial decisions |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |date=30 December 2021 |volume=16 |issue=12 |pages=1214â€“1233 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsab079 |pmid=34160604 |pmc=8717062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this study confirmed that altruism is supported by distinct mechanisms from giving motivated by reciprocity or by fairness. This study also confirmed that the right ventral striatum is recruited during altruistic giving, as well as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, bilateral [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and bilateral anterior [[Insular cortex|insula]], which are regions previously implicated in [[empathy]].

[[Abigail Marsh]] has conducted studies of real-world altruists that have also identified an important role for the [[amygdala]] in human altruism. In real-world altruists, such as people who have donated kidneys to strangers, the amygdala is larger than in typical adults. Altruists' amygdalas are also more responsive than those of typical adults to the sight of others' distress, which is thought to reflect an empathic response to distress.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Marsh |first1=Abigail A. |last2=Stoycos |first2=Sarah A. |last3=Brethel-Haurwitz |first3=Kristin M. |last4=Robinson |first4=Paul |last5=VanMeter |first5=John W. |last6=Cardinale |first6=Elise M. |date=2014-10-21 |title=Neural and cognitive characteristics of extraordinary altruists |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=111 |issue=42 |pages=15036â€“15041 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1408440111 |doi-access=free |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=4210306 |pmid=25225374|bibcode=2014PNAS..11115036M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Brethel-Haurwitz |first1=Kristin M. |last2=O'Connell |first2=Katherine |last3=Cardinale |first3=Elise M. |last4=Stoianova |first4=Maria |last5=Stoycos |first5=Sarah A. |last6=Lozier |first6=Leah M. |last7=VanMeter |first7=John W. |last8=Marsh |first8=Abigail A. |date=2017-10-25 |title=Amygdalaâ€“midbrain connectivity indicates a role for the mammalian parental care system in human altruism |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |language=en |volume=284 |issue=1865 |pages=20171731 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2017.1731 |issn=0962-8452 |pmc=5666102 |pmid=29070724}}&lt;/ref&gt; This structure may also be involved in altruistic choices due to its role in encoding the value of outcomes for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rhoads |first1=Shawn A |last2=O'Connell |first2=Katherine |last3=Berluti |first3=Kathryn |last4=Ploe |first4=Montana L |last5=Elizabeth |first5=Hannah S |last6=Amormino |first6=Paige |last7=Li |first7=Joanna L |last8=Dutton |first8=Mary Ann |last9=VanMeter |first9=Ashley Skye |last10=Marsh |first10=Abigail A |title=Neural responses underlying extraordinary altruists' generosity for socially distant others |journal=PNAS Nexus |date=3 July 2023 |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=pgad199 |doi=10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad199 |pmc=10321390 |pmid=37416875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the findings of research in non-human animals, which has  identified neurons within the amygdala that specifically encode the value of others' outcomes, activity in which appears to drive altruistic choices in monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dal Monte |first1=Olga |last2=Chu |first2=Cheng C.

[[Daniel Batson]], a psychologist, examined this question and argued against the social exchange theory. He identified four significant motives: to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle ([[principlism]]). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that [[empathy]]-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.&lt;ref name=&quot;baston2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batson|first1= C.

Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with personal distress, which compels people to reduce their unpleasant emotions and increase their positive ones by helping someone in need. Empathy is thus not selfless since altruism works either as a way to avoid those negative, unpleasant feelings and have positive, pleasant feelings when triggered by others' need for help or as a way to gain social reward or avoid social punishment by helping. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid allowing it unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through [[prosocial behavior]]s such as [[Helping behavior|helping]], comforting, [[sharing]], cooperation, [[philanthropy]], and [[community service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;prosocial&quot;/&gt; People are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress.

How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and &quot;build the good society&quot;.

==Religious viewpoints==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religion}}
Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Sikhism]], etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.

===Buddhism===
[[File:Monks collecting alms - Bun Vat Phu.JPG|thumb|Monks collecting alms]]
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. [[Love]] and [[compassion]] are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. &quot;Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being&quot; ([[Dalai Lama]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by the Dalai Lama&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Medicine of Altruism|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003223717/http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm |archive-date=3 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The phrase &quot;core of our being&quot; is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von WÃ¼lfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | pages = 226â€“244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 | issue = 3 | pmid = 32545937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes the practitioner's own happiness: &quot;The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes&quot; (Dalai Lama).&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by the Dalai Lama&quot;/&gt;

In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

===Jainism===
{{see also|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Ahinsa.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicting the Jain concept of {{transliteration|sa|ahimsa}} (non-injury)]]
The fundamental principles of [[Jainism]] revolve around altruism, not only for{{ambiguous|reason=does &quot;for&quot; mean &quot;towards&quot; or &quot;by&quot; in this phrase?|date=July 2023}} humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches {{transliteration|sa|[[ahimsa]]}} â€“ to live and let live, not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal{{Specify|reason=equal in what way, on what dimension?|date=July 2023}}. The first {{transliteration|sa|[[Tirthankara]]}}, [[Rishabhdev]], introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence, and compassion for all living things.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

The principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become {{transliteration|sa|Siddha}} ([[God in Jainism]]). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

===Christianity===
{{Catholic philosophy}}
[[Thomas Aquinas]] interprets &quot;You should love your neighbour as yourself&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Leviticus|19}} and {{Bibleverse|Matthew|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that &quot;the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship&quot; he quotes Aristotle that &quot;the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves&quot;,.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Nicomachean Ethics]] IX.4 1166a1&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the [[common good]], the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thought we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily lifeâ€”since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal [[Beatitudes|beatitude]]: a more desirable thing than bodily well-being. In coining the word &quot;altruism&quot;, as stated above, [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism. The aim and focus of Christian life is a life that glorifies God, with obeying christ's command to treat others equally, caring for them and understanding eternity in heaven is what Jesus Resurrection at calvary was all about.

Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. {{Bibleverse|1 John|4}} states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. [[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.

German philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, &quot;motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one's own life and existence&quot;.&lt;ref name=Ressentiment&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|88â€“89}} Another way is merely &quot;one of the many modern substitutes for love,... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people's business&quot;.{{r|Ressentiment|pages=95â€“96}} At its worst, Scheler says, &quot;love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse.&quot;{{r|Ressentiment|pages=96â€“97}}

===Islam===
In  the [[Arabic language]], &quot;{{transliteration|ar|'iythar}}&quot; ([[Ø¥ÙŠØ«Ø§Ø±]]) means &quot;preferring others to oneself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;'iythar [https://translate.google.com/?sl=ar&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%B1&amp;op=translate Google Translate]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the topic of donating blood to non-Muslims (a controversial topic within the faith),  the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] religious professor, [[Fadhil al-Milani]] has provided theological evidence that makes it positively justifiable. In fact, he considers it a form of religious sacrifice and ''ithar'' (altruism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Schmiedel|first1=Ulrich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJhMDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=fadhil+al-milani&amp;pg=PA296|title=Religion in the European Refugee Crisis|last2=Smith|first2=Graeme|date=2018-02-15|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-67961-7|pages=295â€“96|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Sufism|Sufis]], 'iythar means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by [[God in Islam|God]] on the human body, considered to be property of God alone. The importance of 'iythar (aka {{transliteration|ar|Ä«thÄr}}) lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[Islam]] considers those practicing {{transliteration|ar|Ä«thÄr}} as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = M.

This is similar to the notion of [[chivalry in Islam|chivalry]]. A constant concern for God results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Neusner| first = Jacob Eds| title = Altruism in World Religions| year = 2005| publisher = Georgetown Univ.

===Judaism===
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Ben Zion |last2=Bokser |last1=Kook |first1=Abraham Isaac| title = Abraham Isaac Kook: The lights of penitence, The moral principles, Lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems|url=https://archive.org/details/abrahamisaackook00benz |url-access=registration | year = 1978| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 978-0-8091-2159-5| pages = [https://archive.org/details/abrahamisaackook00benz/page/135 135â€“136]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love is defined as [[Tzedakah|bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. [[Kabbalah]] defines God as the force of giving in [[existence]]. Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] focused on the &quot;purpose of creation&quot; and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this force of giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Luzzatto| first = Moshe á¸¤ayyim| title = The way of God| year = 1997| publisher = Feldheim Publishers| isbn = 978-0-87306-769-0| pages = 37â€“38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[Kabbalah]] developed by Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], in his writings about the [[future generation]], focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref name=Ashlag&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 978-965-7065-34-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120â€“130}} Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].{{r|Ashlag|pages = 175â€“180 }}

===Sikhism===
Altruism is essential to the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religion. The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed anyone can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, and truthfulness. {{transliteration|sa|[[SevÄ]]}}, or [[selfless service]] to the community for its own sake, is an important concept in Sikhism.&lt;ref name=&quot;DictofSikhism&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/APopularDictionaryOfSikhism |title=A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism |publisher=Curzon Press|author1=Cole, W.

The fifth [[Guru]], [[Arjun Dev]], sacrificed his life to uphold &quot;22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity&quot;, the [[Guru Granth]]. The ninth Guru, [[Tegh Bahadur]], sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity.

In the late seventeenth century, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] (the tenth Guru in Sikhism), was at war with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;GobindSingh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthesikh025030mbp/page/n7 |title=A History of the Sikhs |publisher=Oxford University Press|first= Joseph Davey|last= Cunningham |date=1918 |page=ix |access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh, and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield. &quot;What were you doing, and why?&quot; asked the Guru. &quot;I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them&quot;, replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru responded, &quot;Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru.&quot;

Under the tutelage of the Guru, Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism, which is still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = O.

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism Selflessness ({{transliteration|sa|Atmatyag}}), Love ({{transliteration|sa|Prema}}), Kindness ({{transliteration|sa|Daya}}), and Forgiveness ({{transliteration|sa|Kshama}}) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or &quot;{{transliteration|sa|Manushyattva}}&quot;. Giving alms to the beggars or poor people is considered as a divine act or &quot;{{transliteration|sa|Punya}}&quot; and Hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or &quot;{{transliteration|sa|Paapa}}&quot; and will led them to heaven or &quot;{{transliteration|sa|Swarga}}&quot; in afterlife. Altruism is also the central act of various Hindu mythology and religious poems and songs. Mass donation of clothes to poor people ({{transliteration|sa|Vastraseva}}), or blood donation camp or mass food donation ({{transliteration|sa|Annaseva}}) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] supports the doctrine of karma yoga (achieving oneness with God through action) &amp; &quot;[[Nishkam Karma]]&quot; or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism. Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and are central to Hindu morality.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38â€“41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{main|Altruism (ethics)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2023}}
There is a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]] maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kraut |first=Richard |title=Altruism |date=2020 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2020/entries/altruism/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |access-date=2024-01-16 |edition=Fall 2020 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing view is [[ethical egoism]], which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with [[utilitarianism]], which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.

A related concept in [[descriptive ethics]] is [[psychological egoism]], the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. [[Rational egoism]] is the view that [[rationality]] consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).

===Effective altruism===
{{See also|Effective altruism|Earning to give|Giving What We Can}}
[[Effective altruism]] is a [[philosophy]] and [[social movement]] that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacAskill |first1=William |title=Effective Altruism: Introduction |journal=Essays in Philosophy |date=2017 |volume=18 |issue=1 |doi=10.7710/1526-0569.1580 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based upon their values.&lt;ref name=&quot;vox&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8457895/givewell-open-philanthropy-charity|title = You have $8 billion.

== Extreme Altruism ==

===Pathological altruism===
Pathological altruism is altruism taken to an unhealthy extreme, such that it either harms the altruistic person or the person's well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good.

The term &quot;pathological altruism&quot; was popularised by the book ''[[Pathological Altruism]]''.

Examples include [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[Occupational burnout|burnout]] seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199738571.001.0001 |title=Pathological Altruism |date=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-973857-1 |editor-last1=Oakley |editor-last2=Knafo |editor-last3=Madhavan |editor-last4=Wilson |editor-first1=Barbara |editor-first2=Ariel |editor-first3=Guruprasad |editor-first4=David Sloan }}{{pn|date=May 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Extreme altruism also known as costly altruism, extraordinary altruism, or heroic behaviours (shall be distinguished from [[Hero|heroism]]), refers to selfless acts directed to a stranger which significantly exceed the normal altruistic behaviours, often involving risks or great cost to the altruists themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Since acts of extreme altruism are often directed towards strangers, many commonly accepted models of simple altruism appear inadequate in explaining this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Waal |first1=Frans B.M. |title=Putting the Altruism Back into Altruism: The Evolution of Empathy |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |date=1 January 2008 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=279â€“300 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093625 |pmid=17550343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the initial concepts was introduced by Wilson in 1976, which he referred to as â€œhard-coreâ€ altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=John P. |title=Motivation, modeling, and altruism: A Person Ã— Situation analysis. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=December 1976 |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=1078â€“1086 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.34.6.1078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form is characterised by impulsive actions directed towards others, typically a stranger and lacking incentives for reward. Since then, several papers have mentioned the possibility of such altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Piliavin |first1=Jane Allyn |last2=Charng |first2=Hong-Wen |title=Altruism: A Review of Recent Theory and Research |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |date=1990 |volume=16 |pages=27â€“65 |doi=10.1146/annurev.so.16.080190.000331 |jstor=2083262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krebs |first1=Dennis L. |title=Altruism and Egoism: A False Dichotomy? |journal=Psychological Inquiry |date=1991 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=137â€“139 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0202_9 |jstor=1449250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current{{when|date=April 2024}} slow progress in the field is due to general ethical guidelines that restrict exposing research participants to costly or risky decisions.{{fact|date=April 2024}} Consequently, much research has based their studies on living organ donations and the actions of [[Carnegie Hero Fund|Carnegie Hero medal Recipients]], actions which involve high risk, high cost, and are of infrequent occurrences.{{fact|date=April 2024}} A typical example of extreme altruism would be non-directed kidney donation - a living person donating one of their kidneys to a stranger without any benefits or knowing the recipient.

However, current research can only be carried out on a small population that meets the requirements of extreme altruism. Most of the time the research is also via the form of self-report which could lead to self-report biases.{{fact|date=April 2024}} Due to the limitations, the current gap between high stakes and normal altruism remains unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

=== Characteristics of Extreme Altruists ===

* Norms

In 1970, Schwartz hypothesised that extreme altruism is positively related to a personâ€™s moral norms and is not influenced by the cost associated with the action.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rusch |first=Hannes |date=2022 |title=Heroic behavior: A review of the literature on high-stakes altruism in the wild |journal=Current Opinion in Psychology |language=en |volume=43 |pages=238â€“243 |doi=10.1016/j.copsyc.2021.07.024|pmid=34454246 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis was supported in the same study examining bone marrow donors. Schwartz discovered that individuals with strong personal norms and those who attribute more responsibility to themselves are more inclined to participate in bone marrow donation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Similar findings were observed in a 1986 study by Piliavin and Libby focusing on blood donors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; These studies suggest that personal norms lead to the activation of moral norms, leading individuals to feel compelled to help others.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

* Enhanced Fear Recognition

Abigail Marsh has described psychopaths as the â€œoppositeâ€ group of people to extreme altruists&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marsh |first1=Abigail A. |title=Understanding amygdala responsiveness to fearful expressions through the lens of psychopathy and altruism |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Research |date=June 2016 |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=513â€“525 |doi=10.1002/jnr.23668 |pmid=26366635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has conducted a few research, comparing these two groups of individuals. Utilising techniques such as brain imaging and behavioural experiments, Marshâ€™s team observed that kidney donors tend to have larger amygdala sizes and exhibit better abilities in recognizing fearful expressions compared to psychopathic individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, an improved ability to recognize fear has been associated with an increase in prosocial behaviours, including greater charity contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Marsh |first1=Abigail A. |last2=Kozak |first2=Megan N. |last3=Ambady |first3=Nalini |date=2007 |title=Accurate identification of fear facial expressions predicts prosocial behavior |journal=Emotion |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=239â€“251 |doi=10.1037/1528-3542.7.2.239 |pmc=2743452 |pmid=17516803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fast Decisions when Perform Acts of Extreme Altruism. 

Rand and Epstein explored the behaviours of 51 Carnegie Hero Medal Recipients, demonstrating how extreme altruistic behaviours often stem from system I of the [[Dual process theory|Dual Process Theory]], which leads to rapid and intuitive behaviours.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rand |first1=David G. |last2=Epstein |first2=Ziv G. |title=Risking Your Life without a Second Thought: Intuitive Decision-Making and Extreme Altruism |journal=PLOS ONE |date=15 October 2014 |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=e109687 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0109687 |pmid=25333876 |doi-access=free |pmc=4198114 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...9j9687R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a separate by Carlson et al. indicated that such prosocial behaviours are prevalent in emergencies where immediate actions are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carlson |first1=Ryan W. |last2=Aknin |first2=Lara B. |last3=Liotti |first3=Mario |title=When is giving an impulse? An ERP investigation of intuitive prosocial behavior |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |date=July 2016 |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=1121â€“1129 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsv077 |pmc=4927032 |pmid=26084530 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery has led to ethical debates, particularly in the context of living organ donation, where laws regarding this issue differ by country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-33799-4 |title=Regulations Regarding Living Organ Donation in Europe |date=2013 |last1=Lopp |first1=Leonie |isbn=978-3-642-33798-7 }}{{pn|date=May 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; As observed in extreme altruists, these decisions are made intuitively, which may reflect insufficient consideration. Critics are concerned about whether this rapid decision encompasses a thorough cost-benefit analysis and question the appropriateness of exposing donors to such risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedman Ross |first1=Lainie |last2=Glannon |first2=Walter |last3=Josephson |first3=Michelle A. |last4=Thistlethwaite |first4=J. Richard |title=Should all living donors be treated equally? |journal=Transplantation |date=August 2002 |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=418â€“421 |doi=10.1097/00007890-200208150-00025 |pmid=12177627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Social Discounting

One finding suggests how extreme altruists exhibit lower levels of social discounting as compared to others. With that meaning extreme altruists place a higher value on the welfare of strangers than a typical person does.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vekaria |first1=Kruti M. |last2=Brethel-Haurwitz |first2=Kristin M. |last3=Cardinale |first3=Elise M. |last4=Stoycos |first4=Sarah A. |last5=Marsh |first5=Abigail A. |title=Social discounting and distance perceptions in costly altruism |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |date=28 April 2017 |volume=1 |issue=5 |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Low Social-Economic Status 

Analysis of 676 [[Carnegie Hero Fund|Carnegie Hero Award Recipients]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Ronald C. |title=Attributes of carnegie medalists performing acts of heroism and of the recipients of these acts |journal=Ethology and Sociobiology |date=September 1996 |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=355â€“362 |doi=10.1016/S0162-3095(96)00059-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another study on 243 rescuing acts&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyons |first1=Minna T. |title=Who are the Heroes? Characteristics of People Who Rescue Others |journal=Journal of Cultural and Evolutionary Psychology |date=September 2005 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=245â€“254 |doi=10.1556/JCEP.3.2005.3-4.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reveal that a significant proportion of rescuers come from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Johnson attributes the distribution to the high-risk occupations that are more prevalent between lower socioeconomic groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Another hypothesis proposed by Lyons is that individuals from these groups may perceive they have less to lose when engaging in high-risk extreme altruistic behaviours.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Possible Explanations ===
Evolutionary theories such as the kin-selection, reciprocity, vested interest and punishment either contradict or do not fully explain the concept of extreme altruism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.4324/9781315690100 |title=Handbook of Heroism and Heroic Leadership |date=2016 |isbn=978-1-317-42611-0 |url=https://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/id/eprint/48727/6/Rotella-A-48727-AAM.pdf |editor-last1=Allison |editor-last2=Goethals |editor-last3=Kramer |editor-first1=Scott T. |editor-first2=George R. |editor-first3=Roderick M. }}{{pn|date=May 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, considerable research has attempted for a separate explanation for this behaviour. Â 

* Costly Signalling Theory for Extreme Behaviours

Research suggests that males are more likely to engage in heroic and risk-taking behaviours due to a preference among females for such traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kelly |first1=Susan |last2=Dunbar |first2=R. I. M. |title=Who dares, wins: Heroism versus altruism in women's mate choice |journal=Human Nature |date=June 2001 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=89â€“105 |doi=10.1007/s12110-001-1018-6 |pmid=26192164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These extreme altruistic behaviours could serve to act as an unconscious â€œsignalâ€ to showcase superior power and ability compared to ordinary individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; When an extreme altruist survives a high-risk situation, they send an â€œhonest signalâ€ of quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; Three qualities hypothesized to be exhibited by extreme altruists, which could be interpreted as &quot;signals,&quot; are: (1) traits that are difficult to fake, (2) a willingness to help, and (3) generous behaviours.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

* Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis

The empathy altruism hypothesis appears to align with the concept of extreme altruism without contradiction. The hypothesis was supported with further brain scanning research, which indicates how this group of people demonstrate a higher level of empathy concern. The level of empathy concern then triggers activation in specific brain regions, urging the individual to engage in heroic behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=FeldmanHall |first1=Oriel |last2=Dalgleish |first2=Tim |last3=Evans |first3=Davy |last4=Mobbs |first4=Dean |date=January 2015 |title=Empathic concern drives costly altruism |journal=NeuroImage |language=en |volume=105 |pages=347â€“356 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.10.043 |pmc=4275572 |pmid=25462694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Mistakes and Outliers

While most altruistic behaviours offer some form of benefit, extreme altruism may sometimes result from a mistake where the victim does not reciprocate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; Considering the impulsive characteristic of extreme altruists, some researchers suggest that these individuals have made a wrong judgement during the cost-benefit analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, extreme altruism might be a rare variation of altruism where they lie towards to ends of a normal distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; In the US, the annual prevalence rate per capita is less than 0.00005%, this shows the rarity of such behaviours.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Digital altruism==
'''Digital altruism''' is the notion that some are willing to freely share information based on the principle of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] and in the belief that in the end, everyone benefits from [[sharing]] information via the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Klisanin&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klisanin|first=Dana|author-link=Dana Klisanin|year=2011|title=Is the Internet Giving Rise to New Forms of Altruism|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/85256/internetaltruism-klisanin.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/85256/internetaltruism-klisanin.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=dead|journal=Media Psychology Review|volume=3|number=1|pages=1â€“11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of digital altruism: (1) &quot;everyday digital altruism&quot;, involving expedience, ease, moral engagement, and conformity; (2) &quot;creative digital altruism&quot;, involving creativity, heightened moral engagement, and cooperation; and (3) &quot;co-creative digital altruism&quot; involving creativity, moral engagement, and meta cooperative efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klisanin&quot;/&gt;

Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays, Rand achieved fame with her 1943 novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. In 1957, she published her best-selling work, the novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own [[Objectivist periodicals|periodicals]] and releasing several collections of essays.

Rand advocated [[reason]] and rejected [[faith]] and religion. She supported [[Rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]] as opposed to [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]. In politics, she condemned the [[initiation of force]] as immoral and supported [[laissez-faire capitalism|''laissez-faire'' capitalism]], which she defined as the system based on recognizing [[individual rights]], including [[private property]] rights. Although she opposed [[libertarianism]], which she viewed as [[anarchism]], Rand is often associated with the modern [[libertarian movement in the United States]]. In art, she promoted [[romantic realism]]. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, with a few exceptions.

Rand's books have sold over 37 million copies. Her fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics, with reviews becoming more negative for her later work.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=117â€“119}} Although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death,{{sfn|Cocks|2020|p=15}} academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected Rand's philosophy, arguing that she has a polemical approach and that her work lacks methodological rigor.{{sfn|Badhwar|Long|2020}} Her writings have politically influenced some [[right-libertarians]] and [[conservatives]]. The [[Objectivist movement]] circulates her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.

==Life==

===Early life===
Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on February&amp;nbsp;2, 1905, into a Jewish [[bourgeois]] family living in [[Saint Petersburg]] in what was then the [[Russian Empire]].{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=xiii}} She was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum, a pharmacist, and Anna Borisovna ({{nÃ©e|Kaplan}}).{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=3â€“5}} She was 12 when the [[October Revolution]] and the rule of the [[Bolsheviks]] under [[Vladimir Lenin]] disrupted her family's lives. Her father's pharmacy was nationalized,{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=31}} and the family fled to [[Yevpatoria]] in Crimea, which was initially under the control of the [[White Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=35}} After graduating high school there in June 1921,{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=36}} she returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was then named),{{efn|The city was renamed ''Petrograd'' from the Germanic ''Saint Petersburg'' in 1914 because Russia was at war with Germany. In 1924 it was renamed ''Leningrad''. The name ''Saint Petersburg'' was restored in 1991.{{sfn|Ioffe|2022}}}} where they faced desperate conditions, occasionally nearly starving.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|pp=86â€“87}}

[[File:Pola Negri by Ayn Rand cover.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Book cover with black-and-white drawings and text in Russian|Rand's first published work was a monograph in Russian about actress Pola Negri.]]
When Russian universities were opened to women after the revolution, Rand was among the first to enroll at [[Petrograd State University]].{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=15}} At 16, she began her studies in the department of [[social pedagogy]], majoring in history.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=72}} She was one of many bourgeois students purged from the university shortly before graduating. After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, many purged students, including Rand, were reinstated.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=47}}{{sfn|Britting|2004|p=24}} She graduated from the renamed Leningrad State University in October 1924.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=15}}{{sfn|Sciabarra|1999|p=1}} She then studied for a year at the State [[Tekhnikum|Technicum]] for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For an assignment, Rand wrote an essay about the Polish actress [[Pola Negri]]; it became her first published work.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=49â€“50}} She decided her professional surname for writing would be ''Rand'',{{sfn|Britting|2004|p=33}} and she adopted the first name ''Ayn'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|aÉª|n}}).{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=9}}{{efn|She may have taken ''Rand'' as her surname because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt {{lang|ru|Ð Ð·Ð½Ð±}} of her birth surname {{lang|ru|Ð Ð¾Ð·ÐµÐ½Ð±Ð°ÑƒÐ¼}} in [[Cyrillic]].{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=55}} Rand said ''Ayn'' was adapted from a [[Finnish language|Finnish]] name.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=19, 301}} Some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a nickname based on the Hebrew word {{lang|he| ×¢×™×Ÿ}} (''[[ayin]]'', meaning 'eye').{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=55â€“57}} Letters from Rand's family do not use such a nickname.&lt;ref&gt;Milgram, Shoshana. &quot;The Life of Ayn Rand: Writing, Reading, and Related Life Events&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Salmieri|2016|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In late 1925, Rand was granted a [[Travel visa|visa]] to visit relatives in Chicago.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=18â€“19}} She arrived in New York City on February&amp;nbsp;19, 1926.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=53}} Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with her relatives learning English{{sfn|Hicks}} before moving to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], California.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=57â€“60}}

In Hollywood a chance meeting with director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] led to work as an [[Extra (acting)|extra]] in his film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter.{{sfn|Britting|2004|pp=34â€“36}} While working on ''The King of Kings'', she met the aspiring actor [[Frank O'Connor (actor, born 1897)|Frank O'Connor]];{{efn|name=&quot;frank&quot;}} they married on April&amp;nbsp;15, 1929. She became a [[Green card|permanent American resident]] in July 1929 and an [[United States nationality law#Naturalization|American citizen]] on March&amp;nbsp;3, 1931.{{sfn|Britting|2004|p=39}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=71}}{{efn|Rand's immigration papers [[Anglicisation of names|anglicized]] her given name as ''Alice'';{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=53}} her legal married name became ''Alice O'Connor'', but she did not use that name publicly or with friends.&lt;ref&gt;Milgram, Shoshana. &quot;The Life of Ayn Rand: Writing, Reading, and Related Life Events&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Salmieri|2016|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Branden|1986|p=72}}}} She tried to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they could not obtain permission to emigrate.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=96â€“98}}{{sfn|Britting|2004|pp=43â€“44, 52}}

===Early fiction===
{{see also|Night of January 16th|We the Living|Anthem (novella)}}
[[File:Night of January 16th jury flyer front.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Poster for the play Night of January 16th|Rand's play ''[[Night of January&amp;nbsp;16th]]'' opened on Broadway in 1935.]]
Rand's first literary success was the sale of her screenplay ''[[Red Pawn]]'' to [[Universal Studios]] in 1932, although it was never produced.{{sfn|Britting|2004|pp=40, 42}}{{efn|It was later published in ''[[The Early Ayn Rand]]'' along with other screenplays, plays, and short stories that were not produced or published during her lifetime.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=22}}}} Her courtroom drama ''[[Night of January&amp;nbsp;16th]]'', first staged in Hollywood in 1934, reopened successfully on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1935. Each night, a jury was selected from members of the audience; based on its vote, one of two different endings would be performed.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=76, 92}}{{efn|In 1941, [[Paramount Pictures]] produced a [[The Night of January 16th (film)|movie loosely based on the play]]. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=78}}{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|p=87}}}} Rand and O'Connor moved to New York City in December 1934 so she could handle revisions for the Broadway production.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=82}}

Her first novel, the semi-autobiographical{{sfn|Rand|1995|p=xviii}} ''[[We the Living]]'', was published in 1936. Set in [[Soviet Russia]], it focuses on the struggle between the individual and the state. Initial sales were slow, and the American publisher let it go out of print,{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|p=13}} although European editions continued to sell.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She adapted the story as [[The Unconquered (1940 play)|a stage play]], but the Broadway production closed in less than a week.&lt;ref&gt;Britting, Jeff. &quot;Adapting ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In 1942, the novel was adapted without permission into a pair of Italian films, ''Noi vivi'' and ''Addio, Kira''. After Rand's post-war legal claims over the piracy were settled, the films were re-edited with her approval and released as ''[[We the Living (film)|We the Living]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Britting, Jeff. &quot;Adapting ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|pp=167â€“176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} After the success of her later novels, Rand released a revised version in 1959 that has sold over three million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand started her next major novel, ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', in December 1935,{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=98}} but took a break from it in 1937 to write her novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]''.{{sfn|Britting|2004|pp=54â€“55}} The novella presents a [[dystopian]] future world in which [[totalitarian]] collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that the word ''I'' has been forgotten and replaced with ''we''.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=50}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=102}} Protagonists Equality 7-2521 and [[Liberty 5-3000]] eventually escape the collectivistic society and rediscover the word ''I''.{{Sfn|Gladstein|2010|pp=24â€“25}} It was published in England in 1938, but Rand could not find an American publisher at that time. As with ''We the Living'', Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, and this sold over 3.5&amp;nbsp;million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''Anthem''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005a|pp=24â€“27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Fountainhead'' and political activism===
{{see also|The Fountainhead|The Fountainhead (film)}}
During the 1940s, Rand became politically active. She and her husband were full-time volunteers for Republican [[Wendell Willkie]]'s 1940 presidential campaign.{{sfn|Britting|2004|p=57}} This work put her in contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist [[Henry Hazlitt]], who introduced her to the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Despite philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men, and they expressed admiration for her. Mises once called her &quot;the most courageous man in America&quot;, a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said &quot;man&quot; instead of &quot;woman&quot;.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=114}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=249}} Rand became friends with libertarian writer [[Isabel Paterson]]. Rand questioned her about American history and politics during their many meetings, and gave Paterson ideas for her only non-fiction book, ''[[The God of the Machine]]''.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=75â€“78}}{{efn|Their friendship ended in 1948 after Paterson made what Rand considered rude comments to valued political allies.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=130â€“131}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=214â€“215}}}}

[[File:The Fountain Head (1943 1st ed) - Ayn Rand.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Front cover of The Fountainhead|''[[The Fountainhead]]'' was Rand's first bestseller.]]
Rand's first major success as a writer came in 1943 with ''The Fountainhead'',{{sfn|Britting|2004|pp=61â€“78}} a novel about an uncompromising architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as &quot;second-handers&quot; who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. Twelve publishers rejected it before [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] accepted it at the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.{{sfn|Britting|2004|pp=58â€“61}} While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed [[Benzedrine]], an [[amphetamine]], to fight fatigue.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=85}} The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=89}} Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to mood swings and outbursts described by some of her later associates.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=178}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=304â€“305}}

The success of ''The Fountainhead'' brought Rand fame and financial security.{{sfn|Doherty|2007|p=149}} In 1943, she sold the film rights to [[Warner Bros.]] and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] then hired her as a screenwriter and script-doctor for screenplays including ''[[Love Letters (1945 film)|Love Letters]]'' and ''[[You Came Along]]''.{{sfn|Britting|2004|pp=68â€“71}} Rand became involved with the [[anti-Communist]] [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]] and [[American Writers Association]].{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=100â€“101, 123}} In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]], she testified as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the United States [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] that the 1944 film ''[[Song of Russia]]'' grossly misrepresented conditions in the [[Soviet Union]], portraying life there as much better and happier than it was.{{sfn|Mayhew|2005b|pp=91â€“93, 188â€“189}} She also wanted to criticize the lauded 1946 film ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but was not allowed to do so.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=125}} When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations' effectiveness, Rand described the process as &quot;futile&quot;.{{sfn|Mayhew|2005b|p=83}}

After several delays, the [[The Fountainhead (film)|film version]] of ''The Fountainhead'' was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she &quot;disliked the movie from beginning to end&quot; and complained about its editing, the acting and other elements.{{sfn|Britting|2004|p=71}}

[[File:Famous fantastic mysteries 195306.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Magazine cover with a man holding lightning bolts|Rand's novella ''Anthem'' was reprinted in the June 1953 issue of the pulp magazine ''[[Famous Fantastic Mysteries]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''Anthem''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005a|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Following the publication of ''The Fountainhead'', Rand received many letters from readers, some of whom the book had influenced profoundly.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=91}} In 1951, Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers who met at Rand's apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy. The group included future [[chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and Barbara's cousin [[Leonard Peikoff]]. Later, Rand began allowing them to read the manuscript drafts of her new novel, ''Atlas Shrugged''.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=240â€“243}} In 1954, her close relationship with Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair. This change occurred with the knowledge of both their spouses,{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=256â€“259}} although historian Jennifer Burns concludes that her husband Frank O'Connor was likely &quot;the hardest hit&quot; emotionally by the affair.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=157}}

Published in 1957, ''Atlas Shrugged'' is considered Rand's ''[[magnum opus]]''.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=106}}{{sfn|Mayhew|2005b|p=78}} She described the novel's theme as &quot;the role of the mind in man's existenceâ€”and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Salmieri, Gregory. &quot;''Atlas Shrugged'' on the Role of the Mind in Man's Existence&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|p=248}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism]] and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a [[welfare state]] government by going on [[Strike action|strike]] and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, [[John Galt]], describes it as stopping &quot;the motor of the world&quot; by withdrawing the minds of individuals contributing most to the nation's wealth and achievements.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=54}} The novel contains an exposition of Objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gennady Stolyarov II|Stolyarov II, G.]] &quot;The Role and Essence of John Galt's Speech in Ayn Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Younkins|2007|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite many negative reviews, ''Atlas Shrugged'' became an international bestseller,{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=2}} but the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed Rand.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=178}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=303â€“306}} ''Atlas Shrugged'' was her last completed work of fiction, marking the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.{{sfn|Younkins|2007|p=1}}

In 1958, Nathaniel Branden established the Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy through public lectures. He and Rand co-founded ''[[The Objectivist Newsletter]]'' (later renamed ''The Objectivist'') in 1962 to circulate articles about her ideas;{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=321}} she later republished some of these articles in book form. Rand was unimpressed by many of the NBI students{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=303}} and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.{{sfn|Doherty|2007|pp=237â€“238}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=329}}{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=235}} Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, later said the NBI culture was one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand. Some described the NBI or the [[Objectivist movement]] as a [[cult]] or religion.{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|pp=105â€“106}}{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=232â€“233}} Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair. Some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=236â€“237}} Some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated, and the problem was concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=235}}{{sfn|Doherty|2007|p=235}}

===Later years===
Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through nonfiction and speeches,{{sfn|Branden|1986|pp=315â€“316}}{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=14}} including annual lectures at the [[Ford Hall Forum]].{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=16}} In answers to audience questions, she took controversial stances on political and social issues. These included supporting abortion rights,{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=320â€“321}} opposing the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[military draft]] (but condemning many [[draft dodgers]] as &quot;bums&quot;),{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=228â€“229, 265}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=352}} supporting Israel in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as &quot;civilized men fighting savages&quot;,{{sfn|BrÃ¼hwiler|2021|p=202 n114}}{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=266}} claiming [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] had the right to invade and take land inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]],{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=266}}&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Stephen. &quot;Topographies of Liberal Thought: Rand and Arendt and Race&quot;. In {{harvnb|Cocks|2020|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and calling homosexuality &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;, despite advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=362, 519}} She endorsed several [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates for president of the United States, most strongly [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]].{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=204â€“206}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=322â€“323}}

[[File:Ayn Rand Marker.jpg|thumb|alt=Twin gravestone for Frank O'Connor and Ayn Rand O'Connor|Grave marker for Rand and her husband at [[Kensico Cemetery]] in [[Valhalla, New York]]{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=405}}]]
In 1964, Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress [[Patrecia Scott]], whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. As her relationship with Nathaniel Branden deteriorated, Rand had her husband be present for difficult conversations between her and Branden.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=360â€“361}} In 1968, Rand learned about Branden's relationship with Scott. Though her romantic involvement with Nathaniel Branden was already over,{{sfn|Britting|2004|p=101}} Rand ended her relationship with both Brandens, and the NBI closed.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=374â€“375}} She published an article in ''The Objectivist'' repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and &quot;irrational behavior in his private life&quot;.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=378â€“379}} In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=276}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=398â€“400}}

Rand had surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=391â€“393}} In 1976, she retired from her newsletter and, despite her lifelong objections to any government run program, was enrolled in and subsequently claimed [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] government assistance with the aid of a social worker.{{sfn|McConnell|2010|pp=520â€“521}}{{sfn|Weiss|2012|p=62}} Her activities in the Objectivist movement declined, especially after her husband died on November&amp;nbsp;9, 1979.{{sfn|Branden|1986|pp=392â€“395}} One of her final projects was a never-completed television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged''.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=406}}

On March&amp;nbsp;6, 1982, Rand died of heart failure at her home in New York City.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=410}} Her funeral included a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign.{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|p=20}} In her will, Rand named Peikoff as her heir.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=400}}

==Literary approach, influences and reception==
Rand described her approach to literature as &quot;[[romantic realism]]&quot;.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=179}} She wanted her fiction to present the world &quot;as it could be and should be&quot;, rather than as it was.&lt;ref&gt;Britting, Jeff. &quot;Adapting ''The Fountainhead'' to Film&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2006|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters. Her fiction typically has [[protagonists]] who are heroic individualists, depicted as fit and attractive.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=26}} Her villains support duty and collectivist moral ideals. Rand often describes them as unattractive, and some have names that suggest negative traits, such as Wesley Mouch in ''Atlas Shrugged''.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=27}}{{sfn|Baker|1987|pp=99â€“105}}

Rand considered plot a critical element of literature,{{sfn|Torres|Kamhi|2000|p=64}} and her stories typically have what biographer Anne Heller described as &quot;tight, elaborate, fast-paced plotting&quot;.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=64}} [[Romantic triangle]]s are a common plot element in Rand's fiction; in most of her novels and plays, the main female character is romantically involved with at least two men.{{sfn|Duggan|2019|p=44}}&lt;ref&gt;Wilt, Judith. &quot;The Romances of Ayn Rand&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gladstein|Sciabarra|1999|pp=183â€“184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
[[File:Victor Hugo by Ã‰tienne Carjat 1876 - full.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of Victor Hugo|Rand admired the novels of [[Victor Hugo]].]]
In school, Rand read works by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Edmond Rostand]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]], who became her favorites.{{sfn|Britting|2004|pp=17, 22}} She considered them to be among the &quot;top rank&quot; of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] writers because of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots.{{sfn|Torres|Kamhi|2000|p=59}} Hugo was an important influence on her writing, especially her approach to plotting. In the introduction she wrote for an English-language edition of his novel ''[[Ninety-Three]]'', Rand called him &quot;the greatest novelist in world literature&quot;.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=32â€“33}}

Although Rand disliked most Russian literature, her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the [[Russian Symbolists]]{{sfn|Grigorovskaya|2018|pp=315â€“325}} and other nineteenth-century Russian writing, most notably the 1863 novel ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' by [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]].{{sfn|Kizilov|2021|p=106}}{{sfn|Weiner|2020|pp=6â€“7}} Scholars of Russian literature see in Chernyshevsky's character Rakhmetov, an &quot;ascetic revolutionist&quot;, the template for Rand's literary heroes and heroines.{{sfn|Johnson|2000|pp=47â€“67}}

Rand's experience of the Russian Revolution and early Communist Russia influenced the portrayal of her villains. Beyond ''We the Living'', which is set in Russia, this influence can be seen in the ideas and rhetoric of Ellsworth Toohey in ''The Fountainhead'',{{sfn|Rosenthal|2004|pp=220â€“223}} and in the destruction of the economy in ''Atlas Shrugged''.{{sfn|Kizilov|2021|p=109}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|2004|pp=200â€“206}}

Rand's descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies; her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early Hollywood movie scenarios. They often follow common film editing conventions, such as having a broad [[establishing shot]] description of a scene followed by [[close-up]] details, and her descriptions of women characters often take a &quot;[[male gaze]]&quot; perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Gladstein, Mimi Reisel. &quot;Ayn Rand's Cinematic Eye&quot;. In {{harvnb|Younkins|2007|pp=109â€“111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary reviews===
[[File:Ayn Rand (1957 Phyllis Cerf portrait).jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Photo of Rand|Rand in 1957]]
The first reviews Rand received were for ''Night of January 16th''. Reviews of the Broadway production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.{{sfn|Branden|1986|pp=122â€“124}} Although Rand believed that ''We the Living'' was not widely reviewed, over 200 publications published approximately 125 different reviews. Overall, they were more positive than those she received for her later work.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;Reviews of ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|pp=147â€“151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anthem'' received little review attention, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;Reviews of ''Anthem''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005a|pp=55â€“60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first bestseller, ''The Fountainhead'', received far fewer reviews than ''We the Living'', and reviewers' opinions were mixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;''The Fountainhead'' Reviews&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2006|pp=77â€“82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorine Pruette]]'s positive review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', which called the author &quot;a writer of great power&quot; who wrote &quot;brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly&quot;,{{sfn|Pruette|1943|p=BR7}} was one that Rand greatly appreciated.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=152}} There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them for either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;/&gt; Some negative reviews said the novel was too long;{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=117â€“119}} others called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style &quot;offensively pedestrian&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;/&gt;

''Atlas Shrugged'' was widely reviewed, and many of the reviews were strongly negative.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=117â€“119}}&lt;ref name=&quot;asreviews&quot;&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;The ''Atlas Shrugged'' Reviews&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|pp=133â€“137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atlas Shrugged'' received positive reviews from a few publications,&lt;ref name=&quot;asreviews&quot;/&gt; but Rand scholar [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] later wrote that &quot;reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs&quot;, with reviews including comments that it was &quot;written out of hate&quot; and showed &quot;remorseless hectoring and prolixity&quot;.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=117â€“119}} [[Whittaker Chambers]] wrote what was later called the novel's most &quot;notorious&quot; review{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=174}}{{sfn|Doherty|2007|p=659 n4}} for the conservative magazine ''[[National Review]]''. He accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Soviets]]), claiming, &quot;From almost any page of ''Atlas Shrugged'', a voice can be heard ... commanding: 'To a gas chamberâ€”go!{{' &quot;}}.{{sfn|Chambers|1957|p=596}}{{efn|Although she was previously friendly with ''National Review'' editor [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], Rand cut off all contact with him after the review was published.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=285â€“286}} Historian Jennifer Burns describes the review as a break between Buckley's religious conservatism and non-religious libertarianism.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=175}}}}

Rand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels. The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, ''[[For the New Intellectual]]'', was similar to that for ''Atlas Shrugged''.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=119}} Philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] likened her certainty to &quot;the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union&quot;,{{sfn|Hook|1961|p=28}} and author [[Gore Vidal]] called her viewpoint &quot;nearly perfect in its immorality&quot;.{{sfn|Vidal|1962|p=[https://archive.org/details/rockingboat00vida/page/234 234]}} These reviews set the pattern for reaction to her ideas among [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] critics.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=193â€“194}} Her subsequent books got progressively less review attention.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=119}}

===Academic assessments of Rand's fiction===
Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was limited. Mimi Reisel Gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.{{sfn|Gladstein|2003|pp=373â€“374, 379â€“381}} Since her death, scholars of English and American literature have continued largely to ignore her work,{{sfn|Gladstein|2003|p=375}} although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.{{sfn|Gladstein|2003|pp=384â€“391}} Several academic book series about important authors cover Rand and her works,{{efn|These include Twayne's United States Authors (''Ayn Rand'' by James T. Baker), Twayne's Masterwork Studies (''The Fountainhead: An American Novel'' by Den Uyl and ''Atlas Shrugged: Manifesto of the Mind'' by Gladstein), and Re-reading the Canon (''Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand'', edited by Gladstein and Sciabarra).{{sfn|Sciabarra|2003|p=43}}}} as do popular study guides like [[CliffsNotes]] and [[SparkNotes]].{{sfn|Gladstein|2003|pp=382â€“389}} In ''[[The Literary Encyclopedia (English)|The Literary Encyclopedia]]'' entry for Rand written in 2001, [[John David Lewis]] declared that &quot;Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation.&quot;{{sfn|Lewis|2001}} In 2019, [[Lisa Duggan]] described Rand's fiction as popular and influential on many readers, despite being easy to criticize for &quot;her cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots, her rigid moralizing, her middle- to lowbrow aesthetic preferences&amp;nbsp;... and philosophical strivings&quot;.{{sfn|Duggan|2019|p=4}}

==Philosophy==
{{Objectivist movement}}
{{main|Objectivism}}
Rand called her philosophy &quot;Objectivism&quot;, describing its essence as &quot;the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute&quot;.{{sfn|Rand|1992|pp=1170â€“1171}} She considered Objectivism a [[systematic philosophy]] and laid out positions on [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], and [[political philosophy]].{{sfn|Gladstein|Sciabarra|1999|p=2}}

===Metaphysics and epistemology===
In metaphysics, Rand supported [[philosophical realism]] and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, Douglas J. &amp; Rasmussen, Douglas B. &quot;Ayn Rand's Realism&quot;. In {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=3â€“20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed in [[free will]] as a form of [[agent causation]] and rejected [[determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rheins, Jason G. &quot;Objectivist Metaphysics: The Primacy of Existence&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Salmieri|2016|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In aesthetics, Rand defined art as a &quot;selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments&quot;.{{sfn|Torres|Kamhi|2000|p=26}} According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be grasped easily, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|pp=191â€“192}} As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature. In works such as ''[[The Romantic Manifesto]]'' and ''[[The Art of Fiction: A Guide for Writers and Readers|The Art of Fiction]]'', she described [[Romanticism]] the approach that most accurately reflects the existence of human free will.{{sfn|Gotthelf|2000|p=93}}

In epistemology, Rand considered all knowledge to be based on forming higher levels of understanding from sense perception, the validity of which she considered [[axiom]]atic.{{sfn|Gotthelf|2000|p=54}} She described reason as &quot;the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Salmieri, Gregory. &quot;The Objectivist Epistemology&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Salmieri|2016|p=283}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand rejected all claims of non-perceptual knowledge, including {{&quot; '}}instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing{{' &quot;}}.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=403 n20}} In her ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]'', Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the [[analyticâ€“synthetic dichotomy]].{{sfn|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005|p=1997}}{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=85â€“86}} She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Salmieri, Gregory. &quot;The Objectivist Epistemology&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Salmieri|2016|pp=271â€“272}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators, including [[Hazel Barnes]], Nathaniel Branden, and [[Albert Ellis]], have criticized Rand's focus on the importance of reason. Barnes and Ellis said Rand was too dismissive of emotion and failed to recognize its importance in human life. Branden said Rand's emphasis on reason led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|pp=173â€“176}}

===Ethics and politics===
In ethics, Rand argued for [[Rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]] (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should &quot;exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Darryl. {{&quot; '}}A Human Society': Rand's Social Philosophy&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Salmieri|2016|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand referred to egoism as &quot;the virtue of selfishness&quot; in her [[The Virtue of Selfishness|book of that title]].{{sfn|Kukathas|1998|p=55}} In it, she presented her solution to the [[isâ€“ought problem]] by describing a [[meta-ethical]] theory that based morality in the needs of &quot;man's survival &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; man&quot;, which requires the use of a rational mind.{{sfn|Badhwar|Long|2020}} She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness,{{sfn|Badhwar|Long|2020}} and held the [[initiation of force]] was evil and irrational,{{sfn|Gotthelf|2000|p=91}} writing in ''Atlas Shrugged'' that &quot;Force and mind are opposites&quot;.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=252}}

Rand's ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy.{{sfn|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=165}} Several authors, including [[Robert Nozick]] and William F. O'Neill in two of the earliest academic critiques of her ideas,{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=100, 115}} said she failed in her attempt to solve the isâ€“ought problem.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=224}} Critics have called her definitions of ''egoism'' and ''altruism'' biased and inconsistent with normal usage.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=220}} Critics from religious traditions oppose her [[atheism]] and her rejection of altruism.{{sfn|Baker|1987|pp=140â€“142}}

Rand's political philosophy emphasized [[individual rights]], including [[Private property|property rights]]. She considered ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights.{{sfn|Gotthelf|2000|pp=91â€“92}} Rand opposed [[Collectivism and individualism|collectivism]] and [[statism]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, John David &amp; Salmieri, Gregory. &quot;A Philosopher on Her Times: Ayn Rand's Political and Cultural Commentary&quot;.

In {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Salmieri|2016|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her preferred form of government was a [[constitutional]] republic that is limited to the protection of individual rights.{{sfn|Peikoff|1991|pp=367â€“368}} Although her political views are often classified as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or [[libertarian]], Rand preferred the term &quot;radical for capitalism&quot;. She worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=174â€“177, 209, 230â€“231}}{{sfn|Doherty|2007|pp=189â€“190}} Rand rejected [[anarchism]] as a naive theory based in [[subjectivism]] that would lead to collectivism in practice,{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|pp=261â€“262}} and denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|pp=248â€“249}}{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=268â€“269}}

Several critics, including Nozick, have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Fred D., Jr. &amp; Mossoff, Adam. &quot;Ayn Rand's Theory of Rights: An Exposition and Response to Critics&quot;. In {{harvnb|Salmieri|Mayhew|2019|pp=135â€“142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like libertarian philosopher [[Michael Huemer]], have gone further, saying that her support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Fred D., Jr. &amp; Mossoff, Adam. &quot;Ayn Rand's Theory of Rights: An Exposition and Response to Critics&quot;. In {{harvnb|Salmieri|Mayhew|2019|pp=146â€“148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, like [[Roy Childs]], have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism, rather than limited government.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=260, 442 n33}}{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=116}}

}}
Except for Aristotle, [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[classical liberals]], Rand was sharply critical{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=111}} of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her.{{sfn|O'Neill|1977|pp=18â€“20}}{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=11}} Acknowledging Aristotle as her greatest influence,{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=2}} Rand remarked that in the [[history of philosophy]] she could only recommend &quot;three A's&quot;â€”Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=11}} In a 1959 interview with [[Mike Wallace]], when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded: &quot;Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me.&quot;{{sfn|Podritske|Schwartz|2009|pp=174â€“175}}

In an article for the ''[[Claremont Review of Books]]'', political scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]] criticized Rand's claim that her only &quot;philosophical debt&quot; was to Aristotle. He asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as [[John Locke]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{sfn|Murray|2010}} Rand took early inspiration from Nietzsche,{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=16, 22}}{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|pp=94â€“99}} and scholars have found indications of this in Rand's private journals. In 1928, she alluded to his idea of the &quot;[[Ãœbermensch|superman]]&quot; in notes for an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer [[William Edward Hickman]].{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=24â€“25}} There are other indications of Nietzsche's influence in passages from the first edition of ''We the Living'' (which Rand later revised),&lt;ref&gt;Loiret-Prunet, Valerie. &quot;Ayn Rand and Feminist Synthesis: Rereading ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gladstein|Sciabarra|1999|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in her overall writing style.{{sfn|Badhwar|Long|2020}}&lt;ref&gt;Sheaffer, Robert. &quot;Rereading Rand on Gender in the Light of Paglia&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gladstein|Sciabarra|1999|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time she wrote ''The Fountainhead'', Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas,{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=42}}{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=41, 68}} and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=303â€“304}} Rand's views also may have been influenced by the promotion of egoism among the [[Russian nihilists]], including Chernyshevsky and [[Dmitry Pisarev]],{{sfn|Weinacht|2021|pp=31â€“32}}{{sfn|Offord|2022|p=40}} although there is no direct evidence that she read them.{{sfn|Weinacht|2021|pp=12â€“13}}{{sfn|Offord|2022|pp=38â€“39}}

Rand considered [[Immanuel Kant]] her philosophical opposite and &quot;the most evil man in mankind's history&quot;;{{sfn|Rand|1971|p=4}} she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Salmieri, Gregory. &quot;An Introduction to the Study of Ayn Rand&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Salmieri|2016|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.{{sfn|Hill|2001|p=195}}{{sfn|Register|2004|p=155}} She was also critical of [[Plato]] and viewed his differences with Aristotle on questions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[James G. Lennox|Lennox, James G]]. {{&quot; '}}Who Sets the Tone for a Culture?' Ayn Rand's Approach to the History of Philosophy&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Salmieri|2016|p=325}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's relationship with contemporary philosophers was mostly antagonistic. She was not an academic and did not participate in academic discourse.{{sfn|Machan|2000|p=121}}{{sfn|BrÃ¼hwiler|2021|pp=24â€“26}} She was dismissive of critics and wrote about ideas she disagreed with in a polemical manner without in-depth analysis.{{sfn|BrÃ¼hwiler|2021|pp=24â€“26}}{{sfn|Machan|2000|p=147}} Academic philosophers in turn viewed her negatively and dismissed her as an unimportant figure who should not be considered a philosopher or given any serious response.{{sfn|Badhwar|Long|2020}}{{sfn|BrÃ¼hwiler|2021|p=27}}{{sfn|Cleary|2018}}

===Early academic reaction===
During Rand's lifetime, her work received little attention from academic scholars.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|pp=1â€“2}} In 1967, [[John Hospers]] discussed Rand's ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook, ''An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis''. That same year, Hazel Barnes included a chapter critiquing Objectivism in her book ''An Existentialist Ethics''.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=188, 325}} When the first full-length academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand &quot;a treacherous undertaking&quot; that could lead to &quot;guilt by association&quot; for taking her seriously.{{sfn|O'Neill|1977|p=3}} A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in ''[[The Personalist]]''.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=115}} One of these was &quot;On the Randian Argument&quot; by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who criticized her meta-ethical arguments.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=224}} In the same journal, other philosophers argued that Nozick misstated Rand's case.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=115}} In an article responding to Nozick, [[Douglas Den Uyl]] and [[Douglas B. Rasmussen]] defended her positions, but described her style as &quot;literary, hyperbolic and emotional&quot;.{{sfn|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1978|p=203}}

After her death, interest in Rand's ideas increased gradually.{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|pp=114â€“122}}{{sfn|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005|p=1995}} ''[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]]'', a 1984 collection of essays about Objectivism edited by Den Uyl and Rasmussen, was the first academic book about Rand's ideas published after her death.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=101}} In one essay, political writer Jack Wheeler wrote that despite &quot;the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage&quot;, Rand's ethics are &quot;a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Jack. &quot;Rand and Aristotle&quot;. In {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the Ayn Rand Society was founded as an affiliate of the [[American Philosophical Association]].{{sfn|Gotthelf|2000|pp=2, 25}}

In a 1995 entry about Rand in ''Contemporary Women Philosophers'', Jenny A. Heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed Rand. She said that Rand's philosophy &quot;is regularly omitted from academic philosophy. Yet, throughout literary academia, Ayn Rand is considered a philosopher.&quot;{{sfn|Heyl|1995|p=223}} Writing in the 1998 edition of the ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', political theorist [[Chandran Kukathas]] summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts. He said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of Aristotle's ethics, and her political theory &quot;is of little interest&quot; because it is marred by an &quot;ill-thought out and unsystematic&quot; effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism.{{sfn|Kukathas|1998|p=55}} ''[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]'', a [[multidisciplinary]], [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] devoted to the study of Rand and her ideas, was established in 1999.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2012|p=184}}

===21st-century academic reaction===
In 2009, historian Jennifer Burns identified &quot;an explosion of scholarship&quot; about Rand since 2000,{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=295â€“296}} although as of that year, few universities included Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area.{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|p=116}} From 2002 to 2012, over 60 colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of [[BB&amp;T]] that required teaching Rand's ideas or works; in some cases, the grants were controversial or even rejected because of the requirement to teach about Rand.{{sfn|Flaherty|2015}}{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|pp=116â€“117}}

In a 2010 essay for the [[Cato Institute]], Huemer argued very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics. He attributed the attention she receives to her being a &quot;compelling writer&quot;, especially as a novelist.{{sfn|Huemer|2010}} In 2012, the [[Pennsylvania State University Press]] agreed to take over publication of ''The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies'',{{sfn|Sciabarra|2012|p=183}} and the [[University of Pittsburgh Press]] launched an &quot;Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies&quot; series based on the Society's proceedings.{{sfn|Seddon|2014|p=75}} The Fall 2012 update to the entry about Rand in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' said that &quot;only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously&quot;.{{sfn|Badhwar|Long|2020}} That same year, political scientist [[Alan Wolfe]] dismissed Rand as a &quot;nonperson&quot; among academics, an attitude that writer Ben Murnane later described as &quot;the traditional academic view&quot; of Rand.{{sfn|Murnane|2018|p=3}} In a 2018 article for ''[[Aeon (magazine)|Aeon]]'', philosopher Skye C. Cleary wrote: &quot;Philosophers love to hate Ayn Rand. It's trendy to scoff at any mention of her.&quot; However, Cleary said that because many people take Rand's ideas seriously, philosophers &quot;need to treat the Ayn Rand phenomenon seriously&quot; and provide refutations rather than ignoring her.{{sfn|Cleary|2018}}

In 2020, media critic [[Eric Burns]] said, &quot;Rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime&quot;,{{sfn|Burns|2020|p=261}} but &quot;nobody in the academe pays any attention to her, neither as an author nor a philosopher&quot;.{{sfn|Burns|2020|p=259}} That same year, the editor of a collection of critical essays about Rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held &quot;a stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule&quot; her work,{{sfn|Cocks|2020|p=11}} but he believed more were engaging with her work in recent years.{{sfn|Cocks|2020|p=15}}

Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged'' was the second most popular choice, after the Bible.{{sfn|Doherty|2007|p=11}} Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work.{{sfn|Gladstein|2003|pp=384â€“386}}{{sfn|Murnane|2018|pp=2â€“3}}

Rand's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, like [[Ira Levin]], [[Kay Nolte Smith]] and [[L. Neil Smith]]; she has influenced later writers like [[Erika Holzer]], [[Terry Goodkind]],{{sfn|Riggenbach|2004|pp=91â€“144}} and comic book artist [[Steve Ditko]].{{sfn|Sciabarra|2004|pp=8â€“11}} Rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=168â€“171}} Businessmen such as [[John A. Allison IV|John Allison]] of [[BB&amp;T]] and [[Ed Snider]] of [[Comcast Spectacor]] have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=298}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=412}}

Television shows, movies, songs, and video games have referred to Rand and her works.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2004|pp=4â€“5}}{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=282}} Throughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines,{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=110â€“111}} as well as book-length critiques by authors such as the psychologist Albert Ellis{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=98}} and Trinity Foundation president John W. Robbins.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=101}} Rand or characters based on her figure prominently in novels by American authors,{{sfn|Sciabarra|2004|p=3}} including Kay Nolte Smith, [[Mary Gaitskill]], [[Matt Ruff]], and [[Tobias Wolff]].{{sfn|BrÃ¼hwiler|2021|pp=15â€“22}} [[Nick Gillespie]], former editor-in-chief of ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', remarked: &quot;Rand's is a tortured immortality, one in which she's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist. Jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture.&quot;{{sfn|Chadwick|Gillespie|2005|loc=at 1:55}} Two movies have been made about Rand's life. A 1997 documentary film, ''[[Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life]]'', was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=128}} ''[[The Passion of Ayn Rand (film)|The Passion of Ayn Rand]]'', a 1999 television adaptation of the [[The Passion of Ayn Rand|book of the same name]], won several awards.{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|p=122}} Rand's image also appears on a [[List of people on stamps of the United States#R|1999]] [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States|U.S. postage stamp]] illustrated by artist [[Nick Gaetano]].{{sfn|Wozniak|2001|p=380}}

Rand's works, most commonly ''Anthem'' or ''The Fountainhead'', are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading.&lt;ref&gt;Salmieri, Gregory. &quot;An Introduction to the Study of Ayn Rand&quot;. In {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Salmieri|2016|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, the Ayn Rand Institute has provided free copies of Rand's novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum.{{sfn|Duffy|2012}} The Institute had distributed 4.5&amp;nbsp;million copies in the U.S. and Canada by the end of 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARI2020&quot;/&gt; In 2017, Rand was added to the required reading list for the [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A Level]] Politics exam in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Wang|2017}}

===Political influence===
{{Capitalism sidebar}}
{{see also|Objectivism and libertarianism}}
Although she rejected the labels &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot;,{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=258}}{{sfn|Weiss|2012|p=55}} Rand has had a continuing influence on [[right-wing politics]] and libertarianism.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=4}}{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|pp=107â€“108, 124}} Rand is often considered one of the three most important women (along with [[Rose Wilder Lane]] and Isabel Paterson) in the early development of modern [[American libertarianism]].{{sfn|Burns|2015|p=746}}{{sfn|BrÃ¼hwiler|2021|p=88}} [[David Nolan (libertarian)|David Nolan]], one founder of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], said that &quot;without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist&quot;.{{sfn|Branden|1986|p=414}} In his history of that movement, journalist [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]] described her as &quot;the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large&quot;.{{sfn|Doherty|2007|p=11}} Political scientist [[Andrew Koppelman]] called her &quot;the most widely read libertarian&quot;.{{sfn|Koppelman|2022|p=17}} Historian Jennifer Burns referred to her as &quot;the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right&quot;.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=4}}

The political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the Republican Party),{{sfn|Doherty|2009|p=54}} despite Rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative, like being [[pro-choice]] and an atheist.{{sfn|Weiss|2012|p=155}} She faced intense opposition from [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] and other contributors to the conservative ''National Review'' magazine, which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas.{{sfn|Burns|2004|pp=139, 243}} Nevertheless, a 1987 article in ''The New York Times'' called her the [[Reagan administration]]'s &quot;novelist laureate&quot;.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=279}} Republican [[United States Congress|congressmen]] and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=xii}}{{sfn|BrÃ¼hwiler|2021|p=184}}{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=283}} She has influenced some conservative politicians outside the U.S., such as [[Sajid Javid]] in the United Kingdom, [[Siv Jensen]] in Norway, and [[Ayelet Shaked]] in Israel.{{sfn|BrÃ¼hwiler|2021|pp=174â€“184}}{{sfn|Rudoren|2015}}

[[File:TDTP08.JPG|thumb|alt=Man holding a poster that says &quot;I am John Galt&quot;|A protester's sign at a 2009 Tea Party rally refers to John Galt, the hero of Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged''.]]
The [[financial crisis of 2007â€“2008]] renewed interest in her works, especially ''Atlas Shrugged'', which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=283â€“284}}{{sfn|Doherty|2009|pp=51â€“52}} Opinion articles compared real-world events with the novel's plot.{{sfn|Doherty|2009|p=54}}{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|p=125}} Signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at [[Tea Party protests]].{{sfn|Duggan|2019|p=xiv}}{{sfn|BrÃ¼hwiler|2021|p=146}} There was increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the [[political left]]. Critics blamed the economic crisis on her support of [[Rational egoism#Ayn Rand|selfishness]] and [[free markets]], particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=283}} In 2015, Adam Weiner said that through Greenspan, &quot;Rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the US economy&quot;.{{sfn|Weiner|2020|p=2}} Lisa Duggan said that Rand's novels had &quot;incalculable impact&quot; in encouraging the spread of [[neoliberal]] political ideas.{{sfn|Duggan|2019|p=xiii}} In 2021, [[Cass Sunstein]] said Rand's ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the [[Trump administration]], which he attributed to the &quot;enduring influence&quot; of Rand's fiction.{{sfn|Sunstein|2021|pp=145â€“146}}

===Objectivist movement===
[[File:Leonard Peikoff.tiff|thumb|right|upright|alt=Photo of Leonard Peikoff|Rand's heir [[Leonard Peikoff]] co-founded the Ayn Rand Institute.]]
{{main|Objectivist movement}}
After the closure of the Nathaniel Branden Institute, the Objectivist movement continued in other forms. In the 1970s, Peikoff began delivering courses on Objectivism.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=249}} In 1979, [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]] started a newsletter called ''[[The Intellectual Activist]]'', which Rand endorsed.{{sfn|Sciabarra|2013|p=402 n5}}{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=276}} She also endorsed ''[[The Objectivist Forum]]'', a bimonthly magazine founded by Objectivist philosopher [[Harry Binswanger]], which ran from 1980 to 1987.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=79}}

In 1985, Peikoff worked with businessman Ed Snider to establish the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff, David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as [[The Atlas Society]].{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=280â€“281}}{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|pp=19, 114}} In 2001, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.{{sfn|Gladstein|2010|p=117}}

==Career==
Alain Connes attended high school at {{Interlanguage link|LycÃ©e Saint-Charles (Marseille)|lt=LycÃ©e Saint-Charles|fr|LycÃ©e Saint-Charles (Marseille)}} in [[Marseille]], and was then a student of the [[Classe prÃ©paratoire aux grandes Ã©coles|classes prÃ©paratoires]] in {{Interlanguage link|LycÃ©e Thiers|lt=LycÃ©e Thiers|fr}}. Between 1966 and 1970 he studied at [[Ã‰cole normale supÃ©rieure (Paris)|Ã‰cole normale supÃ©rieure]] in [[Paris]], and in 1973 he obtained a PhD from [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]], under the supervision of [[Jacques Dixmier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

From 1970 to 1974 he was research fellow at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] and during 1975 he held a visiting position at [[Queen's University at Kingston]] in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alain Connes 2021&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=2021-04-22 |title=Curriculum Vitae |url=https://alainconnes.org/cv/ |access-date=2022-09-08 |website=Alain Connes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 he returned to France and worked as professor at Pierre and Marie Curie University until 1980 and at [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]] between 1981 and 1984. Moreover, since 1979 he holds the LÃ©on Motchane Chair at [[Institut des Hautes Ã‰tudes Scientifiques|IHES]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Alain Connes, emeritus professor since 2017 |url=https://www.ihes.fr/en/professeur/alain-connes-2/ |access-date=2023-05-26 |website=[[IHES]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1984 until his retirement in 2017 he held the chair of Analysis and Geometry at [[CollÃ¨ge de France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alain Connes 2021&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2022-04-11 |title=Alain Connes |url=https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/chaire/alain-connes-analyse-et-geometrie-chaire-statutaire/biography |access-date=2023-05-26 |website=[[CollÃ¨ge de France]] |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, he was awarded a distinguished professorship at [[Vanderbilt University]] between 2003 and 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last3=Pm |first3=1:24 |date=4 September 2003 |title=World-class mathematician joins Vanderbilt faculty |url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2003/09/04/world-class-mathematician-joins-vanderbilt-faculty-59929/ |access-date=2023-05-18 |website=[[Vanderbilt University]] |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Ohio State University]] between 2012 and 2021.

In 2000 he was an invited professor at the [[Conservatoire national des arts et mÃ©tiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Alain Connes, Â« GÃ©omÃ©trie non-commutative Â», ''UniversitÃ© de tous les savoirs'', '''4''', 175â€“190, Editions Odile Jacob, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Connes' main research interests revolved around [[operator algebra]]s. Besides [[noncommutative geometry]], he has applied his works in various areas of mathematics and [[theoretical physics]], including [[number theory]], [[differential geometry]] and [[particle physics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hellemans, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-geometer-of-particle &quot;The Geometer of Particle Physics&quot;] '' Scientific American'', 24 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Since the 1990s, he has been a proponent of [[Noncommutative standard model|the spectral Standard Model]], which gives quantum behaviour to positions in spacetime, sidestepping some of the problems with [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Sabine Hossenfelder]] | title = Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray | isbn=978-0465094257 | year = 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his early work on [[von Neumann algebra]]s in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]]s. He also formulated the [[Connes embedding problem]].

Following this, he made contributions in [[K-theory|operator K-theory]] and [[index theory]], which culminated in the [[Baumâ€“Connes conjecture]]. He also introduced [[cyclic homology|cyclic cohomology]] in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative differential geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Moore |first=Calvin |author-link=Calvin C.

'''Allan Dwan''' (born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan'''; April 3, 1885 â€“ December 28, 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer, and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born Joseph Aloysius Dwan in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, Dwan was the younger son of commercial traveler of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan (1857â€“1917) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan (nÃ©e Hunt). The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old on December 4, 1892, by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883â€“1964), became a physician.

Allan Dwan studied engineering at the University of Notre Dame and then worked for a lighting company in Chicago. He had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry, and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Brownlow 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Brownlow, Kevin|author-link=Kevin Brownlow|title=The Parade's Gone By...|publisher=[[Ballantine Books|Ballantine Books, Inc.]]|location=New York|year=1969|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round, and in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frankenstein&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Fournier|first=Pierre|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5706057/the-first-frankenstein-of-the-movies|title=The first Frankenstein of the movies|work=[[io9]]|date=December 4, 2010|access-date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Dwan started his directing career by accident in 1911, when he was sent by his employers to California, in order to locate a company that had vanished. Dwan managed to track the company down, and learned that they were waiting for the film's director (who was an alcoholic) to return from a binge (and allowing them to return to work). Dwan wired back to his employers in Chicago, informing them of the situation, and suggested that they disband the company. They wired back, instructing Dwan to direct the film. When Dwan informed the company of the situation, and that their jobs were on the line, they responded: &quot;You're the best damn director we ever saw&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollywoodDoc&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Man with the Megaphone |series=[[Hollywood (1980 TV series)|Hollywood]] |date=March 11, 1980 |number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwan operated [[Flying A Studios]] in [[La Mesa, California]], from August 1911 to July 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/6833|title=La mesa to honor its tinseltown roots aug. 12â€“13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamesa.patch.com/articles/100-simple-melodramas-were-made-in-la-mesa-100-years-ago|title=Proto-Hollywood: 100 Melodramas Were Made In La Mesa 100 Years Ago|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On August 12, 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the [[Flying A Studios]] origins in [[La Mesa, California]].

After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Dwan directed [[Gloria Swanson]] in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process [[Phonofilm]]. This short, also featuring [[Thomas Meighan]] and [[Henri de la Falaise]], was produced as a joke, for the April 26, 1925 &quot;Lambs' Gambol&quot; for [[The Lambs]], with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.

Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], Dwan directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi (1937 film)|Heidi]]'' (1937) and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938).

Dwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, [[Victor Fleming]], who went on to direct ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'', and [[Marshall Neilan]], who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/SearchResult.aspx?s=&amp;retailCheck=&amp;Type=PN&amp;CatID=DATABIN_DIRECTOR&amp;ID=11207&amp;AN_ID=&amp;searchedFor=Allan_Dwan_|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Allan Dwan, Filmography|access-date=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being one of the last surviving pioneers of the cinema, he was interviewed at length for the 1980 documentary series ''[[Hollywood (British TV series)|Hollywood]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollywoodDoc&quot;/&gt;

He died in Los Angeles at the age of 96, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles|Mission Hills, California]].

Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

Daniel Eagan of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema, stating that his style &quot;is so basic as to seem invisible, but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eagan|first1=Daniel|title=MoMA's Republic Pictures series offers B-movie rediscoveries and restorations|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/momas-republic-pictures-series-offers-b-movie-rediscoveries-and-restorations|website=[[Film Journal International]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Prometheus Global Media, LLC]]|access-date=February 1, 2018|date=January 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131223908/http://www.filmjournal.com/momas-republic-pictures-series-offers-b-movie-rediscoveries-and-restorations|archive-date=January 31, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital and [[List of cities in Algeria|largest city]] is [[Algiers]], located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast.

Inhabited since [[prehistory]], Algeria has been at the crossroads of numerous cultures and civilizations, including the [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Byzantine Greeks]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]]. Its modern identity is rooted in centuries of [[Arab migrations to the Maghreb|Arab Muslim migration waves]] since the seventh century and the subsequent [[Arabization]] of the [[Berbers|Berber]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2024-05-09 |title=Algeria {{!}} Flag, Capital, Population, Map, &amp; Language {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria |access-date=2024-05-15 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en |archive-date=17 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117181437/https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a succession of [[List of Muslim states and dynasties#North Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia)|Islamic Arab and Berber dynasties]] between the eighth and 15th centuries, the [[Regency of Algiers]] was established in 1516 as a largely independent [[tributary state]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], ruling over much of the country's present-day northern territory. After nearly three centuries as a major power in the Mediterranean, the country was [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830|invaded by France]] in 1830 and [[French Algeria|formally annexed]] in 1848, though it was not fully [[French conquest of Algeria|conquered]] and [[pacification of Algeria|pacified]] until 1903. French rule brought [[Pied-Noir|mass European settlement]] that displaced the local population, which was reduced by up to one-third due to warfare, disease, and starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria/Colonial-rule |title=Algeria â€“ Colonial rule |website=Britannica |language=en |access-date=19 December 2023 |archive-date=16 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240116111049/https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria/Colonial-rule |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SÃ©tif and Guelma massacre]] in 1945 catalysed local resistance that culminated in the outbreak of the [[Algerian War]] in 1954. Algeria [[Independence Day (Algeria)|gained its independence]] on 5 July 1962 and declared the People's Democratic Republic on 25 September of that year. The country descended into a [[Algerian Civil War|bloody civil war]] from 1991 to 2002.

Algeria's official languages are [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]] and [[Standard Algerian Berber|Tamazight]]; [[French language in Algeria|French]] is used in media, education, and certain administrative matters. The vast majority of the population speak the [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian dialect of Arabic]]. Most Algerians are [[Arabs]], with [[Berbers]] forming a sizeable minority. [[Islam|Sunni Islam]] is the official religion and practised by 99 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot; /&gt;

Algeria is a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential republic]] composed of [[Provinces of Algeria|58 provinces]] ([[wilaya|''wilayas'']]) and [[Communes of Algeria|1,541 communes]]. It is a [[regional power]] in North Africa and a [[middle power]] in global affairs. The country has the highest [[Human Development Index]] in continental Africa and one of the [[List of African countries by GDP (nominal)|largest economies in Africa]], due mostly to its large petroleum and natural gas reserves, which are the [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|sixteenth]] and [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|ninth largest]] in the world, respectively. [[Sonatrach]], the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa and a major supplier of natural gas to Europe. The [[Algerian People's National Armed Forces|Algerian military]] is one of the largest in Africa, with the [[List of countries with highest military expenditures|highest defence budget]] on the continent and among the highest in the world. Algeria is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Arab League]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]], [[OPEC]], the United Nations, and the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], of which it is a founding member.

The evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from East Africa, or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa.

Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] and [[Mousterian]] styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gi.ulpgc.es/tarha/Ain_Hanech.pdf |title=The Site of Ain Hanech Revisited: New Investigations at this Lower Pleistocene Site in Northern Algeria |publisher=Journal of Archaeological Science |author1=Sahnouni, Mohamed |author2=de Heinzelin, Jean |access-date=14 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510140017/http://www.gi.ulpgc.es/tarha/Ain_Hanech.pdf |archive-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/ain-hanech.html |title=Research at Ain Hanech, Algeria |publisher=Stoneageinstitute.org |access-date=14 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712045121/http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/ain-hanech.html |archive-date=12 July 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Flake tool]] techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;DelsonTattersall2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Delson|author2=Ian Tattersall|author3=John Van Couvering|author4=Alison S.

From their principal center of power at [[Carthage]], the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organisation supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fischer-Bovet2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Christelle Fischer-Bovet|title=Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0sHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00775-8|page=91|access-date=6 January 2019|archive-date=28 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240328154212/https://books.google.com/books?id=z0sHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa.

In 146 BC the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilisation, unequalled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.
[[File:Justinian555AD.png|thumb|right| The lands which make up modern-day Algeria were part of [[Byzantine North Africa]] (The empire in 555 under [[Justinian the Great]], at its greatest extent since the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] ([[vassal state|vassals]] in pink))]]
After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region, Algeria is the second country in the world after Italy, home to the largest number of Roman sites and remains among the most alive and well preserved. Rome, after getting rid of its powerful rival Carthage in the year 146 BC, decided a century later to include Numidia to become the new master of North Africa. They built more than 500 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.penguintravel.com/Offer/RoundtripsandCulturalTours/2062/AlgeriasRomanHeritage.html#:~:text=Algeria%20is%20the%20second%20country,new%20master%20of%20North%20Africa. | title=Algeria's Roman Heritage â€“ Roundtrips and Cultural Tours Penguin Travel | access-date=22 April 2023 | archive-date=22 April 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230422142230/https://www.penguintravel.com/Offer/RoundtripsandCulturalTours/2062/AlgeriasRomanHeritage.html#:~:text=Algeria%20is%20the%20second%20country,new%20master%20of%20North%20Africa. | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products.

The collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] led to the establishment of a native Kingdom based in [[Altava]] (modern-day Algeria) known as the [[Mauro-Roman Kingdom]]. It was succeeded by another Kingdom based in Altava, the [[Kingdom of Altava]]. During the reign of [[Kusaila]] its territory extended from the region of modern-day [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] in the west to the western [[AurÃ¨s]] and later [[Kairouan|Kairaouan]] and the interior of Ifriqiya in the east.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk7BS9XC10QC&amp;pg=PT139 The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live InHugh Kennedy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326164801/https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk7BS9XC10QC&amp;pg=PT139 |date=26 March 2023 }}

===Middle Ages===
{{main|Medieval Muslim Algeria}}
After negligible resistance from the locals, [[Muslims|Muslim]] [[Arabs]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquered Algeria in the early 8th century.

Large numbers of the indigenous Berber people converted to Islam. Christians, Berber and Latin speakers remained in the great majority in Tunisia until the end of the 9th century and Muslims only became a vast majority some time in the 10th.&lt;ref name = jonathan&gt;Jonathan Conant, Staying Roman, 2012, pp. 364â€“365 {{ISBN |978-0-521-19697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the [[Rustamids]], [[Aghlabids]], [[Fatimids]], [[Zirids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]], [[Almohads]] and the [[Abdalwadid|Zayyanids]]. The Christians left in three waves: after the initial conquest, in the 10th century and the 11th. The last were evacuated to [[Sicily]] by the [[Normans]] and the few remaining died out in the 14th century.&lt;ref name = jonathan/&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], North Africa was home to many great scholars, saints and sovereigns including [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah Ibn Quraysh]], the first grammarian to mention Semitic and Berber languages, the great [[Sufism|Sufi]] masters [[Abu Madyan|Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)]] and [[Sidi El Houari]], and the Emirs [[Abd al-Mu'min|Abd Al Mu'min]] and [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|YÄghmÅ«rasen]]. It was during this time that the [[Fatimids]] or children of [[Fatima]], daughter of [[Muhammad]], came to the [[Maghreb]]. These &quot;Fatimids&quot; went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, [[Hejaz]] and the [[Levant]], boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of [[Arabs]] and [[Levant]]ines extending from Algeria to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. To punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|TÄghribÄt]]. In Al-TÄghrÄ«bÄt the Amazigh Zirid Hero [[Khalifa al-Zanati|KhÄlÄ«fÄ Al-ZÄnatÄ«]] asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero [[Abu Zayd al-Hilali|Ä€bu Zayd al-HilalÄ«]] and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The [[Zirid]]s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as [[Fatimid Caliphate]] made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Tihamah, [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|title=Fatimid Dynasty (Islamic dynasty)|encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|access-date=29 August 2013|url-status=live|archive-date=1 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101203234/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |title=Qantara |publisher=Qantara-med.org |access-date=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009220925/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |title=Qantara â€“ Les Almoravides (1056â€“1147) |publisher=Qantara-med.org |access-date=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921185314/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |archive-date=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.

The [[Berber people]] historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and BarnÃ¨s tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], [[Houara]], [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], [[Kutama]], Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR2|title=Histoire des BerbÃ¨res et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn KhaldÅ«n, William MacGuckin Slane|trans-title=History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa|language=fr|page=XV|author=KhaldÅ«n, Ibn|year=1852|access-date=22 August 2020|archive-date=28 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240328154337/https://books.google.com/books?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Berber revolt numerous independent states emerged across the Maghreb. In Algeria the [[Rustamid dynasty|Rustamid Kingdom]] was established. The Rustamid realm stretched from Tafilalt in Morocco to the Nafusa mountains in Libya including south, central and western Tunisia therefore including territory in all of the modern day Maghreb countries, in the south the Rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of [[Mali]] and included territory in [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MmtBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT311 The Puffin History of the World: Volume 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326164803/https://books.google.com/books?id=MmtBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT311 |date=26 March 2023 }},

As the Fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion, they found another means of revenge. Between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] nomad tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulency. The [[Banu Hilal]] and the [[Banu Sulaym]] for example, who regularly disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot their farms. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier decided to destroy what he could not control, and broke a deal with the chiefs of these Beduouin tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fage|first1=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXa4AQAAQBAJ&amp;q=1048+banu+hilal&amp;pg=PA166|title=A History of Africa|last2=Tordoff|first2=with William|date=23 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-79727-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fatimids even gave them money to leave.

Whole tribes set off with women, children, elders, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[GabÃ¨s Governorate|Gabe]]s region, arriving 1051.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfBAAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=1051+banu+hilal|title=The Maghreb Review: Majallat Al-Maghrib|date=1979|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but with each encounter, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the battlefield.

The invasion kept going, and in 1057 the Arabs spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] where they encircled the [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]] (capital of the [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadid Emirate]]), as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago. From there they gradually gained the upper [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] plains. Some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the [[Almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century.

=== Early modern era ===

[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]
In 1516, the Turkish privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[Spain|Spaniards]] with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the Christians, but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble Salim al-Tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions. Their state is known as the [[Regency of Algiers]]. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his [[Fall of Tlemcen (1518)|invasion of Tlemcen]], [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin]] succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force and native Algerians, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792).&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mikaberidze&quot; /&gt;

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. He was a [[Kouloughlis|Kouloughli]] or of mixed origins, as his mother was an Algerian Mooresse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Houtsma|first=M.

Subsequently, with the institution of a regular administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit, known in Algeria as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Ojaq]] who were led by an [[Agha of the Janissaries|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost between 30,000 and 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620â€“21, and had high fatalities in 1654â€“57, 1665, 1691 and 1740â€“42.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Davis|title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500â€“1800|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=978-0-333-71966-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/trent_0116405722392|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:North Africa, from the &quot;Physical And Political Map Of Africa ... 1822&quot;.png|left|thumb|Map of the Regency of Algiers in early 19th century]]

In 1659, the Janissaries stationned in Algiers, also known commonly as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Odjak]] of Algiers; and the Reis or the company of corsair captains rebelled, they removed the Ottoman [[viceroy]] from power, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of &quot;Agha&quot; then &quot;[[Dey]]&quot; in 1671, and the right to select passed to the [[divan]], a council of some sixty military senior officers. Thus Algiers became a sovereign military republic. It was at first dominated by the odjak; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument.

The [[dey]] was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671â€“1830) that the system was in place, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of the Deylikal government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest.

Barbary raids in the Mediterranean continued to attack Spanish merchant shipping, and as a result, the [[Spanish Empire]] launched an [[Invasion of Algiers (1775)|invasion in 1775]], then the [[Spanish Navy]] bombarded Algiers in [[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)|1783]] and [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|1784]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mikaberidze&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=847}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the attack in 1784, the Spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of Algiers as [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]].

From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and ''dÃ©partement'' of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, who became known as ''colons'' and later, as ''[[Pied-Noir]]s.'' Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randell|first=Keith|title=France: Monarchy, Republic and Empire, 1814â€“70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvyGHAAACAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|isbn=978-0-340-51805-2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906031725/https://books.google.com/books?id=AvyGHAAACAAJ|archive-date=6 September 2015|url-status=live}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=Michael H.|title=Migration: A World History|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0199764341|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Horne, Alistair |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954â€“1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=New York|year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59017-218-6 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Europeans settled in [[Oran]] and [[Algiers]], and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Habib Hourani, Malise Ruthven (2002). &quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&amp;pg=PA323 A history of the Arab peoples]''&quot;.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the [[White Africans of European ancestry|European share]] was almost a fifth of the population. The French government aimed at making Algeria an assimilated part of France, and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900. The indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency, but in contrast to the other colonized countries' path in central Asia and [[Caucasus]], Algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, JÃ¶rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

During the [[Second World War]], Algeria came under [[Vichy France|Vichy control]] before being liberated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[Operation Torch]], which saw the first large-scale deployment of [[Military history of the United States during World War II|American troops]] in the [[North African campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USMA-1945&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=United States Military Academy.

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]]. In May 1945, the uprising against the occupying French forces was suppressed through what is now known as the [[SÃ©tif and Guelma massacre]]. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[Algerian War]] began after the publication of the [[Declaration of 1 November 1954]]. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harki]]s and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm | work = BBC News | title = French 'Reparation' for Algerians | date = 6 December 2007 | access-date = 16 November 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100420212617/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm | archive-date = 20 April 2010 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLN used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted [[Torture during the Algerian War of Independence|severe reprisals]].

The war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries. Historians, like [[Alistair Horne]] and [[Raymond Aron]], state that the actual number of Algerian Muslim war dead was far greater than the original FLN and official French estimates but was less than the 1&amp;nbsp;million deaths claimed by the Algerian government after independence. Horne estimated Algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alistair|last=Horne|page=[https://archive.org/details/savagewarofpeace00horn/page/538 538]|title=A Savage War of Peace|isbn=978-0-670-61964-1|year=1978|publisher=Viking Press |url=https://archive.org/details/savagewarofpeace00horn/page/538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war uprooted more than 2&amp;nbsp;million Algerians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin|last=Windrow|page=13|title=The Algerian War 1954â€“62|isbn=1-85532-658-2|date=15 November 1997|publisher=Bloomsbury USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war against French rule concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] and the July 1962 [[Algerian self-determination referendum, 1962|self-determination referendum]].

[[File:Houari Boumediene's Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Houari Boumediene]]]]
Algeria's first president was the Front de LibÃ©ration Nationale ([[FLN (Algeria)|FLN]]) leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Morocco's claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was [[1965 Algerian coup d'Ã©tat|overthrown in 1965]] by [[Houari BoumÃ©diÃ¨ne]], his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly [[Socialism|socialist]] and authoritarian; BoumÃ©dienne continued this trend. However, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalised. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

BoumÃ©dienne's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Prochaska|first=David|title=That Was Then, This Is Now: The Battle of Algiers and After.|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|page=141|access-date=10 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725163300/http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|archive-date=25 July 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS), a broad coalition of Muslim groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

In December 1991 the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State (Algeria)|High Council of State]] was installed to act as the Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between the Front's armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of [[List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War|civilian massacres]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html 98 Die in One of Algerian Civil War's Worst Massacres ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623134112/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html |date=23 June 2017 }}&quot;.

He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a &quot;Civil Concord&quot; initiative, approved in a [[Algerian Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la PrÃ©dication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Armed Islamic Group, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

In November 2008, the [[Algerian Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-24/world/algeria.emergency_1_islamist-party-algerian-press-service-emergency-declaration |title=Algeria Officially Lifts State of Emergency |publisher=CNN |date=24 February 2011 |access-date=27 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301134330/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-24/world/algeria.emergency_1_islamist-party-algerian-press-service-emergency-declaration |archive-date=1 March 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaeo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria|url=http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/countries/north-africa/algeria/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326032434/http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/countries/north-africa/algeria/|archive-date=26 March 2013|access-date=6 January 2013|publisher=African Economic Outlook}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Profile: Algeria |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/algeria/?profile=all |publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213054455/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/algeria/?profile=all |archive-date=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, elections are routinely criticised by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.

On 2 April 2019, Bouteflika resigned from the presidency after [[2019â€“2020 Algerian protests|mass protests]] against his candidacy for a fifth term in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/algeria-parliament-meet-tuesday-interim-president-190406201605242.html |title=Algeria parliament to meet on Tuesday to name interim president |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=6 April 2019 |access-date=7 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407103512/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/algeria-parliament-meet-tuesday-interim-president-190406201605242.html |archive-date=7 April 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2019, [[Abdelmadjid Tebboune]] became Algeria's president, after winning the first round of the [[2019 Algerian presidential election|presidential election]] with a record abstention rate â€“ the highest of all presidential elections since Algeria's democracy in 1989. Tebboune is accused of being close to the military and being loyal to the deposed president. Tebboune rejects these accusations, claiming to be the victim of a witch hunt. He also reminds his detractors that he was expelled from the Government in August 2017 at the instigation of oligarchs languishing in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=17 December 2019 |title=Algeria: Who is new president Abdelmadjid Tebboune? |work=The Africa Report.com |url=https://www.theafricareport.com/21301/algeria-who-is-new-president-abdelmadjid-tebboune/ |access-date=17 December 2021 |archive-date=17 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211217204433/https://www.theafricareport.com/21301/algeria-who-is-new-president-abdelmadjid-tebboune/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2011 breakup of Sudan, and the creation of South Sudan, Algeria has been the largest country in Africa, and the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the [[Sahara]]. To the north, the [[Tell Atlas]] forms with the [[Saharan Atlas]], further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of [[Aures]] and [[TÃ©bessa|Nememcha]] occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is [[Mount Tahat]] ({{convert|3003|m|ft|disp=or}}).

Algeria lies mostly between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19Â°]] and [[37th parallel north|37Â°N]] (a small area is north of 37Â°N and south of 19Â°N), and longitudes [[9th meridian west|9Â°W]] and [[12th meridian east|12Â°E]]. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape ending with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz |first=Helen Chapin |author-link=Helen Chapin Metz |title=Algeria : a country study |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/dztoc.html |publisher=United States Library of Congress |access-date=18 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115052428/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/dztoc.html |archive-date=15 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hoggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|Ø¬Ø¨Ø§Ù„ Ù‡Ù‚Ø§Ø±}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital, Algiers, and just east of [[Tamanghasset]]. Algiers, [[Oran]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], and [[Annaba]] are Algeria's main cities.&lt;ref name=LOC /&gt;

=== Climate and hydrology ===
{{Main|Climate of Algeria}}
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map DZA present.svg|thumb|left|Algeria map of [[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]].]]

In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from {{convert|400|to|670|mm|1|abbr=on}} annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as {{convert|1000|mm|1|abbr=on}} in some years.

Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. Algeria also has [[erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can go up to {{convert|110|Â°F|Â°C|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

{{Main|Wildlife of Algeria}}
[[File:Vulpes zerda.JPG|thumb|left|The [[fennec fox]] is the [[national animal]] of Algeria]]

The varied vegetation of Algeria includes [[coastal]], [[mountainous]] and grassy [[desert]]-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures constituting the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilisation. The most commonly seen animals include the wild [[boar]]s, [[jackal]]s, and [[gazelle]]s, although it is not uncommon to spot [[fennecs]] (foxes), and [[jerboas]]. Algeria also has a small [[African leopard]] and [[Saharan cheetah]] population, but these are seldom seen. A species of deer, the [[Barbary stag]], inhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas. The [[fennec fox]] is the [[national animal]] of Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodges |first=K. |title=National Animals of African Countries |url=http://african.howzit.msn.com/national-animals-of-african-countries?page=10 |access-date=19 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225172955/http://african.howzit.msn.com/national-animals-of-african-countries?page=10 |archive-date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers. The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals. [[Barbary macaque]]s are the sole native monkey. Snakes, [[monitor lizard]]s, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of [[rodent]]s throughout the [[semi arid]] regions of Algeria. Many animals are now extinct, including the [[Barbary lion]]s, [[Atlas bear]]s and [[West African crocodile|crocodile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0014734 Crocodiles in the Sahara Desert: An Update of Distribution, Habitats and Population Status for Conservation Planning in Mauritania] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810113430/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014734 |date=10 August 2018 }}&quot;. ''[[PLOS ONE]]''. 25 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north, some of the native flora includes [[Macchia]] scrub, [[Olive|olive trees]], [[oak]]s, [[cedrus|cedars]] and other [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens ([[Aleppo pine]], [[juniper]], and [[evergreen oak]]) and some deciduous trees. [[Ficus|Fig]], [[eucalyptus]], [[agave]], and various [[Arecaceae|palm trees]] grow in the warmer areas. The [[grape vine]] is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees. [[Acacia]]s with wild [[olive]]s are the predominant flora in the remainder of the [[Sahara]]. Algeria had a 2018 [[Forest Landscape Integrity Index]] mean score of 5.22/10, ranking it 106th globally out of 172 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;FLII-Supplementary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grantham|first1=H.

Elected politicians have relatively little sway over Algeria.

The head of state is the [[President of Algeria]], who is elected for a five-year term. The president is limited to two five-year terms. The [[2019 Algerian presidential election|most recent presidential election]] was planned to be in April 2019, but [[2019 Algerian protests|widespread protests]] erupted on 22 February against the president's decision to participate in the election, which resulted in President Bouteflika announcing his resignation on 3 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/02/algeria-latest-news-president-abdelaziz-bouteflika-resigns|title=Algeria's president Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigns after 20 years|first=Ruth|last=Michaelson|date=3 April 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=5 April 2019|archive-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402200757/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/02/algeria-latest-news-president-abdelaziz-bouteflika-resigns|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdelmadjid Tebboune]], an independent candidate, was elected as president after the election eventually took place on 12 December 2019.

Algeria is included in the [[European Union]]'s [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.
Giving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) that came into force in 2014. It has a budget of â‚¬15.4&amp;nbsp;billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.

In 2009, the French government agreed to compensate victims of nuclear tests in Algeria. Defence Minister Herve Morin stated that &quot;It's time for our country to be at peace with itself, at peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations,&quot; when presenting the draft law on the payouts. Algerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first step and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-offers-compensation-to-victims-sickened-by-nuclear-tests-1.797730|title=France offers compensation to victims sickened by nuclear tests|access-date=3 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104142121/http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-offers-compensation-to-victims-sickened-by-nuclear-tests-1.797730|archive-date=4 November 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in Algeria}}
Algeria has been categorised by the US government funded [[Freedom House]] as &quot;not free&quot; since it began publishing such ratings in 1972, with the exception of 1989, 1990, and 1991, when the country was labelled &quot;partly free.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world|work=Freedom House|access-date=19 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127202423/http://www.freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world|archive-date=27 January 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, the ''Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor'' issued a report regarding violation of [[media freedom]] in Algeria. It clarified that the Algerian government imposed restrictions on [[freedom of the press]]; expression; and right to peaceful demonstration, protest and assembly as well as intensified censorship of the media and websites. Due to the fact that the journalists and activists criticise the ruling government, some media organisations' licenses are cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1629/Algeria-must-stop-crushing-dissent-by-imprisoning-journalists-and-activists|title=Algeria must stop crushing dissent by imprisoning journalists and activists|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|newspaper=Euro-Mediterranean|language=en|date=December 2016|access-date=21 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202064732/http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1629/Algeria-must-stop-crushing-dissent-by-imprisoning-journalists-and-activists|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent and autonomous trade unions face routine harassment from the government, with many leaders imprisoned and protests suppressed.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Provinces of Algeria|Districts of Algeria|Municipalities of Algeria}}
Algeria is divided into 58 [[provinces of Algeria|provinces]] (''[[wilaya]]s''), 553 [[districts of Algeria|districts]] (''[[daÃ¯ra]]s'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Wildfire Management Policies in Algeria: Present and Future Needs1,2|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr245/psw_gtr245_382.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504200710/https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr245/psw_gtr245_382.pdf |archive-date=4 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,541 [[Municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]] (''[[baladiyah]]s''). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its [[Capital city|seat]], which is usually the largest city.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are:&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Algeria}}
[[File:GDP per capita development in Algeria.png| upright=1.35|thumb|right|GDP per capita development in Algeria]]
Algeria's currency is the [[Algerian dinar|dinar]] (DZD). The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; These restrictions are just starting to be lifted off recently although questions about Algeria's slowly-diversifying economy remain.{{cn|date=November 2023}}

Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities among regions.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to offer more than $23&amp;nbsp;billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past five years. The 2010â€“14 public-investment programme will cost US$286&amp;nbsp;billion, 40% of which will go to human development.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173&amp;nbsp;billion in [[foreign currency reserves]] and a large hydrocarbon stabilisation fund. In addition, Algeria's [[List of countries by external debt|external debt]] is extremely low at about 2% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178&amp;nbsp;billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.&lt;ref name=imfart4/&gt;

Algeria has not joined the [[WTO]], despite several years of negotiations but is a member of the [[Greater Arab Free Trade Area]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Members of the GAFTA â€“ Greater Arab Free Trade Area|url=https://www.worlddata.info/trade-agreements/gafta.php|access-date=29 January 2022|website=Worlddata.info|language=en|archive-date=29 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220129230922/https://www.worlddata.info/trade-agreements/gafta.php|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[African Continental Free Trade Area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=KUNA : Algeria officially joins AU free trade agreement â€“ Economics â€“ 16/12/2019|url=https://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2841571&amp;language=en|access-date=29 January 2022|website=kuna.net.kw|archive-date=29 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220129230920/https://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2841571&amp;language=en|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an association agreement with the European Union&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=General presentation of Association Agreement|url=https://www.caci.dz/en-us/Nos%20Services/coop%C3%A9ration%20internationale/Pages/accord-association/Pr%C3%A9sentation-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral-de-l%27Accord-d%27Association.aspx|access-date=29 January 2022|website=caci.dz|archive-date=29 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220129230921/https://www.caci.dz/en-us/Nos%20Services/coop%C3%A9ration%20internationale/Pages/accord-association/Pr%C3%A9sentation-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral-de-l%27Accord-d%27Association.aspx|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doing Business in Algeria|url=http://algiers.usembassy.gov/doing_business_algeria.html|publisher=Embassy of the United States Algiers, Algeria|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228091321/http://algiers.usembassy.gov/doing_business_algeria.html|archive-date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish direct investments have accelerated in Algeria, with total value reaching $5&amp;nbsp;billion. As of 2022, the number of Turkish companies present in Algeria has reached 1,400.

Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an [[OPEC]] member since 1969.

Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.&lt;ref name=imfart4/&gt;

Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downward.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume continues to decline, dropping from 43.2&amp;nbsp;million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011.

===Research and alternative energy sources===
Algeria has invested an estimated 100&amp;nbsp;billion dinars towards developing research facilities and paying researchers. This development program is meant to advance alternative energy production, especially solar and wind power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article1571 |title=Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Algerian Program (English Version) |access-date=31 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101101749/http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article1571 |archive-date=1 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria is estimated to have the largest solar energy potential in the Mediterranean, so the government has funded the creation of a solar science park in Hassi R'Mel. Currently, Algeria has 20,000 research professors at various universities and over 780 research labs, with state-set goals to expand to 1,000. Besides solar energy, areas of research in Algeria include space and satellite telecommunications, nuclear power and medical research.

The overall rate of unemployment was 10% in 2011, but remained higher among young people, with a rate of 21.5% for those aged between 15 and 24. The government strengthened in 2011 the job programs introduced in 1988, in particular in the framework of the program to aid those seeking work (Dispositif d'Aide Ã  l'Insertion Professionnelle).&lt;ref name=&quot;aaeo&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Giants - Rock towers in the Algerian Sahara.jpg|thumb|[[Djanet]]]]

The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.

There are several [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] in Algeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dz|access-date=25 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919064425/https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dz|archive-date=19 September 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad]], the first capital of the [[Hammadid]] empire; [[Tipasa]], a Phoenician and later Roman town; and [[DjÃ©mila]] and [[Timgad]], both [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins; [[M'Zab Valley]], a limestone valley containing a large urbanized [[oasis]]; and the [[Casbah]] of Algiers, an important citadel. The only natural [[World Heritage Site]] is the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]], a mountain range.

===Transport===

[[File:Autoroute est ouest ghomri2.JPG|thumb|The main highway connecting the Moroccan to the Tunisian border was a part of the [[Cairoâ€“Dakar Highway]] project]]

Two trans-African automobile routes pass through Algeria:
* [[Cairo-Dakar Highway]]
* [[Algiers-Lagos Highway]]
The Algerian road network is the densest in Africa; its length is estimated at {{cvt|180,000|km}} of highways, with more than 3,756 structures and a paving rate of 85%. This network will be complemented by the [[Algeria Eastâ€“West Highway|East-West Highway]], a major infrastructure project currently under construction. It is a three-way, {{convert|1216|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} highway, linking [[Annaba]] in the extreme east to the [[Tlemcen]] in the far west. Algeria is also crossed by the [[Trans-Sahara Highway]], which is now completely paved. This road is supported by the Algerian government to increase trade between the six countries crossed: Algeria, [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]], and [[Tunisia]].

===Health===
{{Main|Health in Algeria}}
In 2018, Algeria had the highest numbers of physicians in the Maghreb region (1.72 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to &quot;improved water sources&quot; was around 97.4% of the population in urban areas and 98.7% of the population in the rural areas. Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, and around 93.4% of those living in rural areas, had access to &quot;improved sanitation&quot;. According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of &quot;reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015&quot;. Given Algeria's young population, policy favours preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunisation program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive healthcare free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |title=Library of Congress Country Studies â€“ Algeria |access-date=20 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319155750/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Algerian literature, split between [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]], [[Berber languages|Tamazight]] and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the 20th century include [[Mohammed Dib]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Kateb Yacine]] and [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of [[Amnesty International]], and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tahar Djaout |publisher=French Publishers' Agency |url=http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&amp;pid=517 |access-date=17 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620082020/http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&amp;pid=517 |archive-date=20 June 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]]; [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (modern-day [[Souk Ahras]]); and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria. The works of the [[Senussi|Sanusi]] family in pre-colonial times, and of [[Emir Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Abdelhamid Ben Badis|Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author [[Apuleius]] was born in [[Madaurus]] (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.

Contemporary [[Algerian cinema]] is varies in terms of genre, exploring a wider range of themes and issues. There has been a transition from cinema which focused on the war of independence to films more concerned with the everyday lives of Algerians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Short guide to contemporary Algerian cinema |publisher=Mapping Contemporary Cinema |url=http://www.mcc.sllf.qmul.ac.uk/?p=550 |access-date=1 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311032134/http://www.mcc.sllf.qmul.ac.uk/?p=550 |archive-date=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algerian painters, like [[Mohammed Racim]] and [[Baya (artist)|Baya]], attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonisation, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria. In this line, [[Mohamed Temam]], [[Abdelkhader Houamel]] have also returned through this art, scenes from the history of the country, the habits and customs of the past and the country life. Other new artistic currents including the one of [[M'hamed Issiakhem]], [[Mohammed Khadda]] and [[Bachir Yelles]], appeared on the scene of Algerian painting, abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways, to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations.

The historic roots of Algerian literature go back to the [[Numidia]]n and [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]]n era, when [[Apuleius]] wrote ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety. This period had also known [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Nonius Marcellus]] and [[Martianus Capella]], among many others. The Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionised the Arab world literature, with authors like [[Ahmad al-Buni]], [[Ibn Manzur]] and [[Ibn Khaldoun]], who wrote the [[Muqaddimah]] while staying in Algeria, and many others.

[[Albert Camus]] was an Algerian-born French Pied-Noir author. In 1957, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]].

Today Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.

As a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the ''Algerian trilogy'' of [[Mohammed Dib]], or even ''Nedjma'' of [[Kateb Yacine]] novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work. Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include [[Mouloud Feraoun]], [[Malek Bennabi]], [[Malek Haddad]], [[Moufdi Zakaria]], Abdelhamid Ben Badis, Mohamed LaÃ¯d Al-Khalifa, [[Mouloud Mammeri]], [[Frantz Fanon]], and [[Assia Djebar]].

In the aftermath of the independence, several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene, they will attempt through their works to expose a number of social problems, among them there are [[Rachid Boudjedra]], [[Rachid Mimouni]], [[Leila Sebbar]], [[Tahar Djaout]] and [[Tahir Wattar]].

Currently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure. Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, ''the swallows of Kabul'' and ''the attack'' of [[Yasmina Khadra]], ''the oath of barbarians'' of [[Boualem Sansal]], ''memory of the flesh'' of [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] and the last novel by Assia Djebar ''nowhere in my father's House''.

Many of his pupils went on to be renowned musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Rabah |last=Saadallah |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/581750786 |title=El-Hadj MhÌamed el-Anka : maÃ®tre et rÃ©novateur de la musique chaabi |date=1981 |publisher=Maison des livres |oclc=581750786 |access-date=24 April 2022 |archive-date=28 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240328160944/https://search.worldcat.org/title/581750786 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constantinois [[Andalusian classical music|Malouf]] style is saved by musician from whom [[Mohamed Tahar Fergani]] is a performer.

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Algeria}}
[[File:Mohamed LAKHDAR HAMINA.png|thumb|[[Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina]], one of the most prominent figures in contemporary Arabic cinema.]]

The Algerian state's interest in film-industry activities can be seen in the annual budget of DZD 200 million (EUR 1.3&amp;nbsp;million) allocated to production, specific measures and an ambitious programme plan implemented by the Ministry of Culture to promote national production, renovate the cinema stock and remedy the weak links in distribution and exploitation.

The financial support provided by the state, through the Fund for the Development of the Arts, Techniques and the Film Industry (FDATIC) and the Algerian Agency for Cultural Influence (AARC), plays a key role in the promotion of national production. Between 2007 and 2013, FDATIC subsidised 98 films (feature films, documentaries and short films). In mid-2013, AARC had already supported a total of 78 films, including 42 feature films, 6 short films and 30 documentaries.

According to the European Audiovisual Observatory's LUMIERE database, 41 Algerian films were distributed in Europe between 1996 and 2013; 21 films in this repertoire were Algerian-French co-productions. [[Days of Glory (2006 film)|''Days of Glory'' (2006)]] and [[Outside the Law (2010 film)|''Outside the Law'' (2010)]] recorded the highest number of admissions in the European Union, 3,172,612 and 474,722, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Sahar (25 March 2014) [http://www.obs.coe.int/documents/205595/412951/Rapport_Alg%C3%A9rie_FR_21-05-2014.pdf ALGÃ‰RIE] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203213653/http://www.obs.coe.int/documents/205595/412951/Rapport_Alg%C3%A9rie_FR_21-05-2014.pdf |date=3 February 2016 }}.

Algeria won the {{Lang|fr|[[Palme d'Or]]|italic=no}} for ''[[Chronicle of the Years of Fire]]'' (1975), two Oscars for [[Z (1969 film)|''Z'' (1969)]], and other awards for the Italian-Algerian movie ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]''.

Algerian cuisine is rich and diverse as a result of interactions and exchanges with other cultures and nations over the centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica 1998 v327&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Culture, Traditions, Cuisine | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | date=August 12, 1998 | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria/Cultural-life | access-date=April 2, 2024 | archive-date=3 April 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230403191637/https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria/Cultural-life | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on both land and sea products. Conquests or demographic movement towards the Algerian territory were two of the main factors of exchanges between the different peoples and cultures. The Algerian cuisine is a mix of [[Arab cuisine|Arab]], [[Berber cuisine|Berber]], [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] and [[French cuisine|French]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2019-06-13 |title=The Cuisine of Algeria |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-cuisine-of-algeria.html |access-date=2023-12-19 |website=WorldAtlas |language=en-US |archive-date=19 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231219171838/https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-cuisine-of-algeria.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica 1998 v327&quot;/&gt;

Algerian cuisine offers a variety of dishes depending on the region and the season, but vegetables and [[cereal]]s remain at its core. Most of the Algerian dishes are centered around bread, meats (lamb, beef or poultry), olive oil, vegetables, and fresh herbs. Vegetables are often used for salads, soups, [[tajine]]s, [[couscous]], and sauce-based dishes. Of all the Algerian traditional dishes available, the most famous one is [[Algerian couscous|couscous]], recognized as a national dish.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebin.pub 2005 h182&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia 4 volumes 0313376263, 9780313376269 | website=ebin.pub | date=June 10, 2005 | url=https://ebin.pub/food-cultures-of-the-world-encyclopedia-4-volumes-0313376263-9780313376269.html | page=17 | access-date=April 2, 2024 | archive-date=2 April 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240402225500/https://ebin.pub/food-cultures-of-the-world-encyclopedia-4-volumes-0313376263-9780313376269.html | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Atlas Shrugged'' characters}}
This is a list of characters in [[Ayn Rand]]'s 1957 novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]].''

==Major characters==
The following are major characters from the novel.{{efn|Characters in this article are listed as &quot;major&quot; if they are described as major or primary characters in surveys of Rand's work (such as Gladstein's ''The New Ayn Rand Companion''), in a book or essay collection about the novel (such as ''Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged''), or in a widely available study guide about the novel (such as [[CliffsNotes]] or [[SparkNotes]]).}}

===Protagonists===

====Dagny Taggart====
Dagny Taggart is the [[protagonist]] of the novel. She is vice president in charge of operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. Given James' incompetence, Dagny is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=50}}

====Francisco d'Anconia====
Francisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in ''Atlas Shrugged'', an owner by inheritance of the world's largest [[copper]] mining operation. He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny Taggart. A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the &quot;climax&quot; of the d'Anconia line, an already prestigious Argentine family of skilled industrialists. He was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar DanneskjÃ¶ld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began working while still in school to show that he could have been successful without the aid of his family's wealth. Later, Francisco bankrupts the d'Anconia business to put it out of others' reach. His full name is given as &quot;Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres SebastiÃ¡n d'Anconia&quot;.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=53}}&lt;ref&gt;Milgram, Shoshana. &quot;The Spirit of Francisco d'Anconia: The Development of His Characterization&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|pp=79â€“104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====John Galt====
{{Main|John Galt}}
John Galt is the primary male hero of ''Atlas Shrugged''. He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employees' cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Only Eddie's side of their conversations is given in the novel. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker's true identity.

Before working for Taggart Transcontinental, Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company, where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity, but abandoned his prototype, and his employment, when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment. This prototype was found by Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden. Galt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel, working a job and living by himself, where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership. He delivers a lengthy broadcast speech that presents the author's philosophy of [[Objectivism]].{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=54}}&lt;ref&gt;Ghate, Onkhar. &quot;The Role of Galt's Speech in ''Atlas Shrugged''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|pp=363â€“374}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Rearden====
Henry (known as &quot;Hank&quot;) Rearden is one of the central characters in ''Atlas Shrugged''. He owns the most important steel company in the United States, and invents Rearden Metal, an [[alloy]] stronger, lighter, cheaper and tougher than steel. He lives in [[Philadelphia]] with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother. Rearden represents a type of [[self-made man]] and eventually divorces Lillian, abandons his steel mills following a bloody assault by government-planted workers, and joins John Galt's strike.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=54â€“55}}

====Eddie Willers====
Edwin &quot;Eddie&quot; Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and himself likewise. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. Willers does not possess the creative ability of Galt's associates, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt, Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=76}}&lt;ref&gt;Campbell. Robert L. &quot;When the Train Left the Station, with Two Lights on Behind: The Eddie Willers Story&quot;. In {{harvnb|Younkins|2007|pp=313â€“323}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ragnar DanneskjÃ¶ld====
One of Galt's first followers, and world-famous as a [[pirate]], who seizes relief ships sent from the United States to the People's States of Europe. He works to ensure that once those espousing Galt's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they have enough capital to rebuild the world. Kept in the background for much of the book, DanneskjÃ¶ld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation, and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years. DanneskjÃ¶ld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a retired [[film star]]. Considered a misfit by Galt's other adherents, he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding Galt's perspective.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=53â€“54}}

According to [[Barbara Branden]], who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing DanneskjÃ¶ld's adventures at sea, cut from the final published text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reedstrom |first=Karen |title=Barbara Branden |journal=Full Context |date=Septemberâ€“October 1998 |page=4 |url=http://barbarabranden.com/interview4.html |access-date=14 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1974 comment at a lecture, Rand said that DanneskjÃ¶ld's name was a tribute to Victor Hugo's novel ''[[Hans of Iceland]]'', wherein the hero becomes the first of the Counts of DanneskjÃ¶ld. In the published book, DanneskjÃ¶ld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.

===Antagonists===

====James Taggart====
The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=63â€“64}}

====Lillian Rearden====
The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden, who dislikes his habits and (secretly at first) seeks to ruin Rearden to prove her own value. Lillian achieves this, when she passes information to James Taggart about her husband's affair with his sister. This information is used to blackmail Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to others. Lillian thereafter uses James Taggart for sexual satisfaction, until Hank abandons her.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=63}}

====Dr. Floyd Ferris====
Ferris is a biologist who works as &quot;co-ordinator&quot; at the State Science Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled ''Why Do You Think You Think?'' He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=63}}

====Dr. Robert Stadler====
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar DanneskjÃ¶ld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including a sound-based weapon known as Project X (Xylophone). He is killed when Cuffy Meigs (see below) drunkenly overloads the circuits of Project X, causing it to destroy itself and every structure and living thing in a 100-mile radius.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=63}} The character was, in part, modeled on [[J.

====Wesley Mouch====
The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty. In return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill (which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one, forces Hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. Later in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator, a position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country. Mouch's mantra, whenever a problem arises from his prior policy, is to say, &quot;I can't help it. I need wider powers.&quot;{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=63}}

==Secondary characters==
The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.{{efn|Secondary characters are listed if they appear in character lists from any of the works used to establish the list of major characters above, but do not meet the criteria for &quot;major.&quot; Minor characters who are not listed in secondary works are not listed here.}}

*'''Hugh Akston''' is identified as &quot;One of the last great advocates of reason.&quot; He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University, where he taught Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt, and Ragnar DanneskjÃ¶ld. He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at the job. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental. He is based on [[Aristotle]].{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=58}}&lt;ref&gt;Schoolland, Ken &amp; Havashi, Stuart K. &quot;Hugh Akston, the Role of Teaching, and the Lessons of ''Atlas Shrugged''&quot;.

*'''Jeff Allen''' is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagny's cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest.

She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. Cherryl is at first harsh towards Dagny, having believed Jim Taggart's descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame, but eventually admits to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny. Shortly after making this admission, she commits suicide by jumping over a stone parapet and into the river, unable to live with her evil husband and seeing no way to escape him.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=75}}&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Destruction from the Nihilism Train: The Cheryl Brooks Story&quot;.

*'''Emma Chalmers''', Kip Chalmers' mother, gains some influence after his death. Known as &quot;Kip's Ma,&quot; she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railroad freight cars to move the harvest. As a result, the year's wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=70}}
*'''Kip Chalmers''' is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California. On the way to a campaign rally, the Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine.

When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of [[Colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing.

Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had. Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to Galt's Gulch. Galt recognizes in him a younger version of himself, having emulated both Galt's achievements in physics and Galt's social reasoning.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=58â€“59}}
*'''Balph Eubank''' is called &quot;the literary leader of the age&quot;, despite the fact that no book he has written has sold more than 3,000 copies. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to 10,000 copies. He is a [[misogynist]] who thinks it disgusting that Dagny Taggart is a railroad vice-president.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=70}}
*The '''Fishwife''' is one of the strikers, who earns her living by providing the fish for Hammond's grocery market; she is described as having &quot;dark, disheveled hair and large eyes&quot;, and is a writer.

*'''Richard Halley''' is Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24, his opera ''[[Phaethon]]'' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. After 19 years, ''Phaethon'' was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. It is later revealed that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt's Gulch.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=59}}
*'''Lawrence Hammond''' runs Hammond Cars in Colorado, one of the few companies in existence that still produces top-quality vehicles. He eventually quits and joins the strike.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=59}}

Owen Kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, Galt's Gulch.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=59}}
*'''Fred Kinnan''' is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose.

Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=70-71}}
*'''Paul Larkin''' is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family. He meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down.

*'''Horace Bussby Mowen''' is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut.

Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting the contract.

*'''Dr. Simon Pritchett''' is the prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University and is considered the leading philosopher of the age.

*'''Rearden's mother''', whose name is not mentioned, lives with Rearden at his home in Philadelphia. She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She dotes on her weak son Philip Rearden.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=72}}

*'''Bertram Scudder''' is an editorial writer for the magazine ''The Future''. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called ''The Octopus''. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Scudder claims that the most important thing in life is &quot;brother love&quot; but seems to have nothing but hatred for those around him. He loses his job after Dagny Taggart reveals her affair with Hank Rearden over air on his radio show.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=72}}
*'''Claude Slagenhop''' is president of political organization Friends of Global Progress and one of Lillian Rearden's friends.

*'''Gerald and Ivy Starnes''' are the two surviving children of Jed Starnes, the founder of the Twentieth Century Motor Company. Together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program that drove the company into bankruptcy. Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a [[New Age|pseudo-Buddhist]] ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their father's company was entirely due to the workers. Eric was a weak, attention-seeking man with a pathological desire to be loved. He committed suicide after the woman he loved married another man. Gerald claims that he always acted for the good of the employees, but he was vain and incompetent and often threw lavish parties using company funds. Ivy, on the other hand, is described as a sadist who relishes seeing others in poverty, but who has no desire for wealth of her own.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=72}}
*'''Andrew Stockton''' runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado. When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galt's Gulch.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=60}} 
*'''Mr. Thompson''' is the &quot;[[Head of state|Head of the State]]&quot; for the United States. He is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modeled him on President [[Harry S. Truman]], and that she deliberately decided not to call him &quot;President of the United States&quot; as this title has &quot;honorable connotations&quot; which the character does not deserve.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=73}}
*'''Lester Tuck''' is the campaign manager for Kip Chalmers and one of his guests on the train trip to California. He dies in the Taggart Tunnel disaster.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=72}}
*'''Clem Weatherby''' is a government representative on the board of directors of Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny considers him the least bad of the government representatives, since he does have some real knowledge on the running of trains. She notices, however, that he is the least appreciated by his own bosses.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=72}}
*The '''Wet Nurse (Tony)''' is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden's mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters' code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=75}}&lt;ref&gt;Krupinski, Jotnana. &quot;In the Beginning was the Thought: The Story of the Wet Nurse&quot;. In {{harvnb|Younkins|2007|pp=325â€“329}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ellis Wyatt''' is the head of Wyatt Oil. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of Colorado by discovering a new process for extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil wells. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her brother's policies which directly threaten his business. When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a single note: &quot;I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours.&quot; One particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as &quot;Wyatt's Torch&quot;. Later Dagny meets him in Galt's Gulch.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=60}}

{{Anthropology}}

'''Anthropology''' is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with [[human behavior]], [[human biology]], [[cultures]], [[society|societies]], and [[linguistics]], in both the present and past, including [[archaic humans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Anthropology? | url=https://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150 | publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]] | access-date=10 August 2013 | archive-date=16 February 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216033701/http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]] studies patterns of behavior, while [[cultural anthropology]] studies cultural meaning, including norms and values.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa&quot; /&gt; The term [[sociocultural anthropology]] is commonly used today. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language influences social life. [[Biological anthropology|Biological or physical anthropology]] studies the biological development of humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa&quot; /&gt;

[[Archaeology]], often termed as &quot;anthropology of the past,&quot; studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence. It is considered a branch of anthropology in North America and Asia, while in Europe, archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history and [[palaeontology]].

The abstract noun ''[[wikt:anthropology|anthropology]]'' is first attested in reference to [[history]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oed2&quot; /&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey]]'s 1593 ''Philadelphus'', a defense of the legend of [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] in [[History of Britain|British history]], includes the passage &quot;Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did.

==Origin and development of the term==
{{main|History of anthropology}}
[[File:Bernardino de SahagÃºn (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Bernardino de SahagÃºn]] is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1353/cat.2003.0100| title=Bernardino de Sahagun: First Anthropologist (review)| journal=The Catholic Historical Review| volume=89| issue=2| pages=351â€“352| year=2003| last1=Burkhart| first1=Louise M.| s2cid=162350550}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Through the 19th century===
In 1647, the [[Caspar Bartholin the Elder|Bartholins]], early scholars of the [[University of Copenhagen]], defined ''{{lang|fr|l'anthropologie}}'' as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchy&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartholin | first1=Caspar | last2=Bartholin | first2=Thomas | author-link1=Caspar Bartholin the Younger | author-link2=Thomas Bartholin | others=Translated from the Latin by Abr.

HÃ©nault et J. HÃ©nault | chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.{{refn|group=n|In French: ''L'Anthropologie, c'est Ã  dire la science qui traite de l'homme, est divisÃ©e ordinairment &amp; avec raison en l'Anatomie, qui considere le corps &amp; les parties, et en la Psychologie, qui parle de l'Ame''.&lt;ref name=frenchy/&gt;}}}}

Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by [[Ã‰tienne Serres]] in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the [[National Museum of Natural History, France|French National Museum of Natural History]] by [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de BrÃ©au]]. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The [[SociÃ©tÃ© Ethnologique de Paris]], the first to use the term ''[[ethnology]]'', was formed in 1839 and focused on methodically studying human races. After the death of its founder, [[William FrÃ©dÃ©ric Edwards]], in 1842, it gradually declined in activity until it eventually dissolved in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sibeud |first=Emmanuelle |title=A New History of Anthropology |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=9780470766217 |editor-last=Kuklick |editor-first=Henrika |page=98 |chapter=The Metamorphosis of Ethnology in France, 1839â€“1930 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/newhistoryofanth0000unse/page/98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the [[American Ethnological Society]], was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the [[Ethnological Society of London]] in 1843, a break-away group of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiller131&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|pp=130â€“132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-[[Human rights|human-rights activists.]] They maintained international connections.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in diverse fields such as [[Comparative anatomy|anatomy]], [[Comparative method (linguistics)|linguistics]], and [[ethnology]], started making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, and were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in [[agronomy]] and in the wild.

Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. [[Paul Broca]] in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the [[SociÃ©tÃ© de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|SociÃ©tÃ© d'Anthropologie de Paris]], meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Fletcher | chapter=Paul Broca and the French School of Anthropology | title=The Saturday Lectures, Delivered in the Lecture-room of the U. S. National Museum under the Auspices of the Anthropological and Biological Societies of Washington in March and April 1882 | year=1882 | location=Boston; Washington, DC | publisher=D. Lothrop &amp; Co.; Judd &amp; Detweiler | chapter-url={{Google books|9dEJAQAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|As [[Robert Fletcher (anthropologist)|Fletcher]] points out, the French society was by no means the first to include anthropology or parts of it as its topic. Previous organizations used other names. The German Anthropological Association of St. Petersburg, however, met first in 1861, but due to the death of its founder never met again.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;}} When he read Darwin, he became an immediate convert to ''Transformisme'', as the French called [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition now became &quot;the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broca, being what today would be called a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[Broca's area]] after him. His interest was mainly in [[Biological anthropology]], but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, [[Theodor Waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled ''Die Anthropologie der NaturvÃ¶lker'', 1859â€“1864. The title was soon translated as &quot;The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples&quot;. The last two volumes were published posthumously.

Waitz defined anthropology as &quot;the science of the nature of man&quot;. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from &quot;the animals nearest to him&quot;. He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that &quot;the same laws of thought are applicable to all men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|pp=11â€“12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waitz was influential among British ethnologists. In 1863, the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] and the speech therapist [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] to form the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French ''SociÃ©tÃ©'' were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, ''The Anthropological Review'', Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunt&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|loc=Introductory Address}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Hunt's choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;}} Among the first associates were the young [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[Alfred Tylor]], a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionists. One notable exception was the [[Berliner Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte|Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory]] (1869) founded by [[Rudolph Virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.

During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898, 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Extent of Instruction in Anthropology in Europe and the United States | first=George Grant | last=Maccurdy | journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science | volume=10 | issue=260 | year=1899 | pages=382â€“390 | url={{Google books|PA385|plainurl=yes}} | bibcode=1899Sci....10..910M | doi=10.1126/science.10.260.910 | pmid=17837336 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
Anthropology as a specialized field of academic study developed much through the end of the 19th century. Then it rapidly expanded beginning in the early 20th century to the point where many of the world's higher educational institutions typically included anthropology departments. Thousands of anthropology departments have come into existence, and anthropology has also diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. The organization has also reached a global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), &quot;a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology&quot;, currently contains members from about three dozen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Home | publisher=World Council of Anthropological Associations | access-date=29 March 2015 | url=http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml | archive-date=2 April 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172343/http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[BronisÅ‚aw Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ''social'' anthropology in Great Britain and [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'' anthropology]] in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance they place on [[Participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized [[cultural relativism]], [[holism]], and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79&quot;&gt;Hylland Eriksen, Thomas. (2004) &quot;What is Anthropology&quot; Pluto. London. p. 79. {{ISBN|0-7453-2320-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from [[Boasian anthropology|Boas' arguments]] against 19th-century racial [[ideology]], through [[Margaret Mead]]'s advocacy for [[gender equality]] and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] oppression and promotion of [[multiculturalism]]. [[Ethnography]] is one of its primary [[research design]]s as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994p331&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiro1987&quot;&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E.

In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of [[social anthropology]] tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the [[four field approach]] developed by Franz Boas in the early 20th century: [[Biological anthropology|''biological'' or ''physical'' anthropology]]; [[social anthropology|''social'']], [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'']], or [[sociocultural anthropology|''sociocultural'' anthropology]]; [[archaeology|archaeological anthropology]]; and [[linguistic anthropology]]. These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://americananthro.org/learn-teach/what-is-anthropology/ | title=What is Anthropology? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam FrantiÅ¡ek KollÃ¡r|Adam F. KollÃ¡r]] in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) ''An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology''.

Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from [[natural science]]s, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', human physical traits, [[human behavior]], the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' has influenced its social organization and culture, and from [[social science]]s, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm What is Anthropology â€“ American Anthropological Association] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015065744/http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm |date=15 October 2015 }}.

By Kemal Ataman p. 59 {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, anthropology has been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Language, Anthropology and Cognitive Science |author=Bloch, Maurice |author-link=Maurice Bloch |jstor=2803828 |year=1991 |pages=183â€“198 |volume=26 |issue=2 |journal=Man |doi=10.2307/2803828 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[global studies]], and various [[ethnic studies]].

According to [[Clifford Geertz]],

{{Blockquote|...anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|pages=Back Cover|editor1=Daniel A. Segal |editor2=Sylvia J. Yanagisako |isbn=978-0-8223-8684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sociocultural anthropology]] has been heavily influenced by [[structuralism|structuralist]] and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.{{cn|date=November 2023}} During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.{{cn|date=September 2022}}

===Sociocultural===
{{main|Cultural anthropology|Social anthropology|Sociocultural anthropology}}
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principal axes of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]]. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people ''make sense'' of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the ''relationships'' among individuals and groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994pxv&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=General Introduction | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |author-link=Tim Ingold| year=1994 | page=xv |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-02137-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropology is more related to [[philosophy]], literature and [[the arts]] (how one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to [[sociology]] and history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994pxv&quot;/&gt; In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.

Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by [[cultural relativism]], the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994p331&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Introduction to culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |author-link=Tim Ingold | year=1994 | page=331 |isbn=978-0-415-02137-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1996p18&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Key Debates in Anthropology | author=Tim Ingold | year=1996| page=18|quote=the traditional anthropological project of cross-cultural or cross-societal comparison| author-link=Tim Ingold }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is often accommodated in the field of [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic [[monograph]]. As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. [[Participant observation]] is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernard |first=H. Russell |year=2002 |url=http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |title=Research Methods in Anthropology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002847/http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2016 |publisher=[[Altamira Press]] |page=322 |isbn=978-0-7591-0868-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an [[emic]] (conceptual, vs. [[etic]], or technical) point of view.

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Sociocultural anthropology also covers [[Economic anthropology|economic]] and [[Political anthropology|political organization]], law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).{{cn|date=September 2022}}

Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West. The [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]] (SCCS) includes 186 such cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;MurdockWhite1969&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Standard Cross-Cultural Sample | journal=Ethnology | author=George Peter Murdock | author2=Douglas R.

{{main|Biological anthropology}}
[[File:Human remains.jpg|thumb|[[Forensic anthropology|Forensic anthropologists]] can help identify skeletonized human remains, such as these found lying in scrub in Western Australia, c. 1900â€“1910.]]

Biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[University of Toronto]] |title=Research Subfields: Physical or Biological |access-date=14 March 2012 |url=http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422203737/http://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological===
{{main|Archaeology}}
[[Archaeology]] is the study of the human past through its material remains. Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, R.H. &amp; Larkin, S.N.

[[File:Rosetta Stone.svg|thumb|The [[Rosetta Stone]] was an example of ancient communication.]]

===Linguistic===
{{main|Linguistic anthropology}}
[[Linguistic anthropology]] (not to be confused with [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150|title=What is Anthropology? â€“ Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=25 August 2017|archive-date=26 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026173505/http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, ZdenÄ›k. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnography ===
{{main|Ethnography}}

[[Ethnography]] is a method of analysing social or cultural interaction. It often involves [[participant observation]] though an ethnographer may also draw from texts written by participants of in social interactions.

[[Tim Ingold]] distinguishes ethnography from anthropology arguing that anthropology tries to construct general theories of human experience, applicable in general and novel settings, while ethnography concerns itself with fidelity. He argues that the anthropologist must make his writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other theory but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists and the fields inform one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingold|first=Timothy|date=2008|title=Anthropology is not ethnography|url=https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/anthropology-is-emnotem-ethnography|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|language=English|volume=154|pages=69â€“92|issn=0068-1202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of art}}

==== Art ====
{{main|Anthropology of art}}

One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', [[Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss]]' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.{{cn|date=September 2022}}

==== Media ====
{{main|Media anthropology}}
[[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask, Gabon, Central Africa]]
Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movement]]s, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]], and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitulnik, Deborah |title=Anthropology and Mass Media|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=22|page=293|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.22.100193.001453|url=http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/Spitulnik_MediaAnthro.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/Spitulnik_MediaAnthro.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music ====
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.

Ethnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields, such as teaching, politics, cultural anthropology etc. While the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, it was formally termed &quot;ethnomusicology&quot; by Dutch scholar [[Jaap Kunst]] {{circa|1950}}. Later, the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical ''[[Ethnomusicology (academic journal)|Ethnomusicology]]'' and the [[Society for Ethnomusicology|Society of Ethnomusicology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ethnomusicology|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ethnomusicology|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-05-09|archive-date=18 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918122551/https://www.britannica.com/science/ethnomusicology|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Visual ====
{{main|Visual anthropology}}
Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, [[new media]]. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]]. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphs, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chio |first=Jenny |date=2021-07-26 |title=Visual anthropology |url=https://www.anthroencyclopedia.com/entry/visual-anthropology |journal=Cambridge Encyclopedia of Anthropology |doi=10.29164/21visual |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic, political economic, applied and development ===
{{Economic anthropology}}

==== Economic ====
{{main|Economic anthropology}}
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology, [[BronisÅ‚aw Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55â€“71|author2=Hart, Keith |isbn=978-0-7456-4482-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heffernan|first=Timothy|title=Economic Anthropology in View of the Global Financial Crisis, in The Palgrave Handbook of the History of Human Sciences|year=2022|publisher=Springer Nature|location=Singapore|pages=457â€“481|doi=10.1007/978-981-16-7255-2_14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political economy====
{{main|Political economy in anthropology}}
Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[historical materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the &quot;pre-capitalist&quot; societies that were subject to evolutionary &quot;tribal&quot; stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as the &quot;original affluent society&quot; did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist [[world-system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roseberry 1988 161â€“85&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161â€“185|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==== Applied ====
{{main|Applied anthropology}}
Applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a &quot;complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|isbn=978-0-275-97841-9|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[anthropology of development]]).{{cn|date=September 2022}}

====Development====
{{main|anthropology of development}}
Anthropology of development tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail?

===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}

==== Kinship ====
{{main|Kinship}}
''Kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as &quot;[[kinship|descent]]&quot;, &quot;[[descent group]]s&quot;, &quot;[[lineage (anthropology)|lineages]]&quot;, &quot;[[affinity (law)|affines]]&quot;, &quot;[[cognatic kinship|cognates]]&quot;, and even &quot;[[fictive kinship]]&quot;. Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage. Within kinship you have two different families. People have their biological families and it is the people they share DNA with. This is called [[consanguinity]] or &quot;blood ties&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.inflibnet.ac.in/data-server/eacharya-documents/5717528c8ae36ce69422587d_INFIEP_304/66/ET/304-66-ET-V1-S1__file1.pdf |title=Types of Kinship- Consanguineal and Affinal |work=inflibnet.ac.in |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214160656/http://content.inflibnet.ac.in/data-server/eacharya-documents/5717528c8ae36ce69422587d_INFIEP_304/66/ET/304-66-ET-V1-S1__file1.pdf |access-date=28 November 2023|archive-date=14 February 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=November 2023}} People can also have a chosen family in which they chose who they want to be a part of their family. In some cases, people are closer with their chosen family more than with their biological families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pountney, Laura|title=Introducing anthropology|others=Maric, Tomislav|year= 2015|isbn=978-0-7456-9977-6|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=909318382 |publisher=Polity Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feminist ====
{{main|Feminist anthropology}}
Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white feminists of Europe, America, and elsewhere. From the perspective of the [[Western world]], historically such 'peripheral' perspectives have been ignored, observed only from an outsider perspective, and regarded as less-valid or less-important than knowledge from the Western world{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2022}}. Exploring and addressing that double bias against women from marginalized racial or ethnic groups is of particular interest in [[intersectional]] feminist anthropology.

Feminist anthropologists have stated that their publications have contributed to anthropology, along the way correcting against the systemic biases beginning with the &quot;patriarchal origins of anthropology (and (academia)&quot; and note that from 1891 to 1930 doctorates in anthropology went to males more than 85%, more than 81% were under 35, and only 7.2% to anyone over 40 years old, thus reflecting an age gap in the pursuit of anthropology by [[first-wave feminism|first-wave feminists]] until later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, Maria and Marjorie M. Schweitzer, editors. ''Women in Anthropology: Autobiographical Narratives and Social History.'' (Left Coast Press: Walnut Creek), pp. 15â€“40. {{ISBN|1-59874-083-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This correction of systemic bias may include mainstream [[feminist theory]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[archaeology]], and anthropology. Feminist anthropologists are often concerned with the construction of [[gender]] across societies. Gender constructs are of particular interest when studying [[sexism]].{{cn|date=September 2022}}

According to [[St. Clair Drake]], [[Vera Mae Green]] was, until &quot;[w]ell into the 1960s&quot;, the only [[African-American|African American]] female [[anthropologist]] who was also a [[Caribbeanist]]. She studied ethnic and family relations in the [[Caribbean]] as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1525/aa.1982.84.3.02a00080|title = Vera Mae Green, 1928â€“1982| journal=American Anthropologist| volume=84| issue=3| pages=633â€“635|date = September 1982|last1 = Cole|first1 = Johnnetta B.| doi-access=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Zora Neale Hurston, although often primarily considered to be a literary author, was trained in anthropology by Franz Boas, and published ''Tell my Horse'' about her &quot;anthropological observations&quot; of voodoo in the Caribbean (1938).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2901255|jstor=2901255 |title=Possessing the Self: Caribbean Identities in Zora Neale Hurston's Tell My Horse |last1=Trefzer |first1=Annette |journal=African American Review |date=28 November 2023 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=299â€“312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist anthropology is inclusive of the anthropology of birth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/0-387-29905-X_26 | chapter=Birth | title=Encyclopedia of Medical Anthropology | date=2004 | last1=Sargent | first1=Carolyn | pages=224â€“230 | isbn=978-0-306-47754-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a specialization, which is the anthropological study of [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] within cultures and societies.

===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal===
{{Medical anthropology}}

==== Medical ====
{{main|Medical anthropology}}

Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies &quot;human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation&quot;.&lt;ref name=McElroy1996&gt;{{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor1=D. Levinson |editor2=M. Ember |title=Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology |chapter-url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |access-date=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001162708/http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that William Caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology. Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Dave|date=24 October 2016|title=Anthropology's Contribution to Public Health Policy Development|journal=McGill Journal of Medicine|volume=13|issue=1|page=76|issn=1201-026X|pmc=3277334|pmid=22363184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* The patient-physician relationship
* The integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* The interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
* The critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations (&quot;critical ethnopsychiatry&quot;: Beneduce 2004, 2007)
* The impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings

Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.

==== Nutritional ====
{{main|Nutritional anthropology}}

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and [[economic history|economic trends]] associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==== Psychological ====
{{main|Psychological anthropology}}
Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group&amp;nbsp;â€“ with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories&amp;nbsp;â€“ shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeVine, R.

White |display-editors=etal | date = 1992 | title = New Directions in Psychological Anthropology | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive ====
{{main|Cognitive anthropology}}
Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Andrade&quot;/&gt;

==== Transpersonal ====
{{main|Transpersonal anthropology}}
Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues â€“ for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|text]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schroll, M.

===Political and legal===
{{Political anthropology}}

==== Political ====
{{main|Political anthropology}}
Political anthropology concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more &quot;complex&quot; social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. Firstly, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz's comparative work on &quot;Negara&quot;, the Balinese state, is an early, famous example.

====Legal====
{{main|Legal anthropology}}
Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in &quot;the cross-cultural study of social ordering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |isbn=978-0-8014-1971-3| location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|editor1=Hent de Vries |editor2=Lawrence E. Sullivan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

====Public====
{{main|Public anthropology}}
Public anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to &quot;demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline â€“ illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicanthropology.org/|title=Center for a Public Anthropology|access-date=8 May 2020|archive-date=23 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523175028/https://www.publicanthropology.org/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature, science, and technology ===
{{Cyber anthropology}}

====Cyborg====
{{main|Cyborg anthropology}}
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie (2001). &quot;Cyborg Anthropology&quot;. in ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-92092-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Haraway]]'s 1985 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto]]'' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.{{cn|date=September 2022}}

==== Digital ====
{{main|Digital anthropology}}
Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect. It is sometimes grouped with [[cultural anthropology|sociocultural anthropology]], and sometimes considered part of [[material culture]]. The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases.

Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, century anthropology and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pyke G 1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyke|first1=G H|title=Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=15|page=523|year=1984|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243636746|access-date=10 November 2016|archive-date=3 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403005941/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243636746|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Checker M 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://archive.org/details/pollutedpromises0000chec|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Environment ====
Social sciences, like anthropology, can provide interdisciplinary approaches to the environment. Professor Kay Milton, Director of the Anthropology research network in the School of History and Anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milton, Kay 1951|url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n93016959/|url-status=live|access-date=2 November 2021|website=OCLC WorldCat Identities|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211102211940/http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n93016959/ |archive-date=2 November 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes anthropology as distinctive, with its most distinguishing feature being its interest in non-industrial indigenous and traditional societies. Anthropological theory is distinct because of the consistent presence of the concept of culture; not an exclusive topic but a central position in the study and a deep concern with the human condition. Milton describes three trends that are causing a fundamental shift in what characterizes anthropology: dissatisfaction with the cultural relativist perspective, reaction against cartesian dualisms which obstructs progress in theory (nature culture divide), and finally an increased attention to globalization (transcending the barriers or time/space).

Environmental discourse appears to be characterized by a high degree of globalization. (The troubling problem is borrowing non-indigenous practices and creating standards, concepts, philosophies and practices in western countries.) Anthropology and environmental discourse now have become a distinct position in anthropology as a discipline. Knowledge about diversities in human culture can be important in addressing environmental problems - anthropology is now a study of human ecology. Human activity is the most important agent in creating environmental change, a study commonly found in human ecology which can claim a central place in how environmental problems are examined and addressed. Other ways anthropology contributes to environmental discourse is by being theorists and analysts, or by refinement of definitions to become more neutral/universal, etc. In exploring environmentalism - the term typically refers to a concern that the environment should be protected, particularly from the harmful effects of human activities. Environmentalism itself can be expressed in many ways. Anthropologists can open the doors of environmentalism by looking beyond industrial society, understanding the opposition between industrial and non-industrial relationships, knowing what ecosystem people and biosphere people are and are affected by, dependent and independent variables, &quot;primitive&quot; ecological wisdom, diverse environments, resource management, diverse cultural traditions, and knowing that environmentalism is a part of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Milton|first=Kay|title=Environmentalism and Cultural Theory; Exploring the Role of Anthropology in Environmental Discourse.|publisher=Routledge Press|year=1996|location=New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
{{main|Ethnohistory}} {{See also|Historical anthropology}}
Ethnohistory is the study of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] cultures and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] customs by examining [[History|historical records]]. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, [[folklore]], oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell1979&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3â€“4 | doi = 10.2307/481465 | jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{main|Anthropology of religion}}
The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between [[magical thinking]] and religion,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassirer1944&quot;&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319070726/http://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 |date=19 March 2015 }}, pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122â€“123.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|&quot;It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion.

=== Urban ===
{{main|Urban anthropology}}
Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of [[urbanization]], poverty, and [[neoliberalism]]. [[Ulf Hannerz]] quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were &quot;a notoriously [[agoraphobic]] lot, anti-urban by definition&quot;. Various social processes in the [[Western World]] as well as in the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of &quot;[[#Focus on the &quot;other cultures&quot;|specialists in 'other cultures']]&quot; closer to their homes.&lt;ref name=Hannerz/&gt; There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1466138110370412 |jstor=24047982|title=Chinese consumers: The Romantic reappraisal|journal=Ethnography|volume=11|issue=3|pages=331â€“357|year=2010|last1=Griffiths|first1=M.

== Key topics by field: archaeological and biological ==
{{main|Archaeological|Biological anthropology}}

=== Anthrozoology ===
{{main|Anthrozoology}}
[[Anthrozoology]] (also known as &quot;humanâ€“animal studies&quot;) is the study of interaction between living things. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, [[ethology]], medicine, [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]]. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 &quot;Anthrozoology&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603184431/https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 |date=3 June 2016 }}, ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''.

=== Biocultural ===
{{main|Biocultural anthropology}}
Biocultural anthropology is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and culture. [[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Goodman |editor-first=Alan H. |editor-link=Alan H.

=== Evolutionary ===
{{main|Evolutionary anthropology}}
Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominins]] and non-hominin [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

=== Forensic ===
{{main|Forensic anthropology}}
Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of [[physical anthropology]] and human [[osteology]] in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of [[decomposition]]. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective &quot;forensic&quot; refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.

=== Palaeoanthropology ===
{{main|Palaeoanthropology}}
[[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the seven known fossil teeth of ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'' found in [[Callao Cave]]]]
Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of [[paleontology]] and [[physical anthropology]]. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in [[fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evidence such as [[Petrifaction|petrifacted]] bones and footprints. Genetics and morphology of specimens are crucially important to this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kelso|first1=Janet|last2=PÃ¤Ã¤bo|first2=Svante|last3=Meyer|first3=Matthias|last4=PrÃ¼fer|first4=Kay|last5=Reich|first5=David|last6=Patterson|first6=Nick|last7=Slatkin|first7=Montgomery|last8=Nickel|first8=Birgit|last9=Nagel|first9=Sarah|date=March 2018|title=Reconstructing the genetic history of late Neanderthals|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=555|issue=7698|pages=652â€“656|doi=10.1038/nature26151|pmid=29562232|pmc=6485383|issn=1476-4687|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/70268/Hajdinjak_2018_T.pdf?sequence=1|bibcode=2018Natur.555..652H|hdl=1887/70268|access-date=24 September 2019|archive-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428034102/https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/70268/Hajdinjak_2018_T.pdf?sequence=1|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markers on specimens, such as [[enamel fracture]]s and [[Tooth decay|dental decay]] on [[Tooth|teeth]], can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1002/ajpa.23250 |pmid=28542710|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317189250|title=Behavioral inferences from the high levels of dental chipping in Homo naledi|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=164|issue=1|pages=184â€“192|year=2017|last1=Towle|first1=Ian|last2=Irish|first2=Joel D.|last3=De Groote|first3=Isabelle|s2cid=24296825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==
Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422181152/http://www.aaanet.org/about/ |date=22 April 2009 }}. AAAnet.org. Retrieved on 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf|date=13 June 2010|title=American Anthropological Association â€“ Monthly Membership Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613021448/http://aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf|archive-date=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.

Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Wong, Kate (2007).

==Ethics==
As the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report of the Commission to Review the AAA Statements on Ethics â€“ Participate &amp; Advocate|url=http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1911&amp;RDtoken=3371&amp;userID=6944|publisher=American Anthropological Association|access-date=18 June 2017|language=en|archive-date=18 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918101620/http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1911&amp;RDtoken=3371&amp;userID=6944|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = &quot;pbuteh&quot;&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) ''Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter.'' Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:
* That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derives some of its key notions from it, consciously or not. (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) [http://okhovvat.com/files/en/content/2011/6/4/351_379.pdf ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403010839/http://okhovvat.com/files/en/content/2011/6/4/351_379.pdf |date=3 April 2017 }}. London/New York: Routledge. pp. 26â€“29. {{ISBN|0-415-08024-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That ethnographic work is often ahistorical, writing about people as if they were &quot;out of time&quot; in an &quot;ethnographic present&quot; (Johannes Fabian, ''Time and Its Other'').
* In his article &quot;The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and Its Consequence&quot;, [[Herbert S. Lewis]] critiqued older anthropological works that presented other cultures as if they were strange and unusual. While the findings of those researchers should not be discarded, the field should learn from its mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Herbert S.|date=1998|title=The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and Its Consequences|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/682051|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=100|issue=3|pages=716â€“731|doi=10.1525/aa.1998.100.3.716|issn=0002-7294|jstor=682051|access-date=30 August 2017|archive-date=3 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403010337/http://www.jstor.org/stable/682051|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural relativism ===
As part of their quest for [[scientific objectivity]], present-day anthropologists typically urge [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994p331&quot;/&gt; This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another's values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi-Strauss|first=Claude|year=1962|title=The Savage Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Womack|first=Mari|year=2001|title=Being Human}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[mutilation]] (including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]]), and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin. ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url-status=live |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Is there a gene for racism? |website=Times Higher Education |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522193840/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 |archive-date=22 May 2011 |date=August 3, 2007 |access-date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]], to [[colonialism]], have been proposed to explain their origins and continued recurrences.

To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as &quot;racism&quot; and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on &quot;Race&quot;|url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm|publisher=American Anthropological Association|date=May 17, 1998|access-date=17 April 2007|archive-date=27 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627184228/http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.654 |pmid=9841421 |title=Cultural Anthropology: DNA Studies Challenge the Meaning of Race |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5389 |pages=654â€“655 |year=1998 |last1=Marshall |first1=E. |bibcode=1998Sci...282..654M |s2cid=22257033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Allan (1995). &quot;The Problematics of &quot;Race&quot; in Contemporary Biological Anthropology.&quot; In ''Biological Anthropology: The State of the Science''.

===Military involvement===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief exposÃ© and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Browman|first=David|date=22 November 2011|title=Spying by American Archaeologists in World War I|journal=Bulletin of the History of Archaeology|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=10â€“17|doi=10.5334/bha.2123|issn=2047-6930|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the [[Axis Powers]] (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David Price (anthropologist)|David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=David H.|date=1 June 1998|title=Cold war anthropology: Collaborators and victims of the national security state|journal=Identities|volume=4|issue=3â€“4|pages=389â€“430|doi=10.1080/1070289X.1998.9962596|issn=1070-289X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up little. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement. Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Richard Borshay |title=The anti-imperialist tradition in North American anthropology: Vietnam, the Left Academy, and the founding of ARPA |journal=Dialectical Anthropology |date=June 2016 |volume=40 |issue=2 |page=60 |doi=10.1007/s10624-016-9412-y |jstor=43895186 |s2cid=146855589 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43895186 |access-date=24 October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The &quot;Principles of Professional Responsibility&quot; issued by the American Anthropological Association and amended through November 1986 stated that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments&amp;nbsp;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1656|title=Past AAA Statements on Ethics â€“ Participate &amp; Advocate|website=www.americananthro.org|access-date=2 May 2019|archive-date=10 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910222429/http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1656|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current &quot;Principles of Professional Responsibility&quot; does not make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethics.americananthro.org/category/statement/|title=Ethics Forum Â» Full Text of the 2012 Ethics Statement|website=Ethics Forum|access-date=2 May 2019|archive-date=2 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502191053/http://ethics.americananthro.org/category/statement/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211195702/http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm |date=11 February 2008 }}. CSMonitor.com (7 September 2007). Retrieved on 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' reports that &quot;Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs&quot; [[War in Afghanistan (2001â€“2021)|in Afghanistan]], under the ''[[Human Terrain System]]'' (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century |url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121225645/http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archive-date=21 January 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities (CEAUSSIC) released its final report concluding, in part, that: {{blockquote |text=When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment â€“ all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application â€“ it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of 'anthropology' within DoD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Final Report on The Army's Human Terrain System Proof of Concept Program |date=2009-10-14 |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/rdcms-aaa/files/production/public/FileDownloads/pdfs/cmtes/commissions/CEAUSSIC/upload/CEAUSSIC_HTS_Final_Report.pdf |last=AAA Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities |access-date=2023-05-23 |publication-date=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Post-World War II developments==
Before [[WWII]] British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

===Basic trends===
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79&quot;/&gt; The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.

In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato (1993). ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. Inda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, John and Rosaldo, Renato (2007). ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Jurmain, Robert; Kilgore, Lynn; Trevathan, Wenda and Ciochon, Russell L. (2007). ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology''. 11th ed. Wadsworth. chapters I, III and IV. {{ISBN|0-495-18779-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wompack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. pp.&amp;nbsp;11â€“20. {{ISBN|0-13-644071-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald (1991). ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughley, Neil (2000). ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists &quot;into the field,&quot; which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called &quot;fieldwork.&quot; On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

===Commonalities between fields===
Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], history, [[philosophy]], and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy (2003). ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;11â€“12. {{ISBN|1-4426-0110-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George (1992) &quot;Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology&quot;, pp. 342â€“361 in George Stocking, ''The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0-299-13414-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray (1979). ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of &quot;other cultures&quot;, both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh University Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al., Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures&amp;nbsp;â€“ Continental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in &quot;other cultures&quot; looked for them far away and started to look &quot;across the tracks&quot; only in late 1960s.&lt;ref name=Hannerz&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz|Hannerz, Ulf]] (1980) ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'', {{ISBN|0-231-08376-9}}, p. 1. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's &quot;home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/682051 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403010337/http://www.jstor.org/stable/682051 |date=3 April 2017 }}'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' &quot;100:&quot; 716â€“731&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody|Goody, Jack]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319071011/http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC |date=19 March 2015 }}''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-87069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = AbÃ©lÃ¨s | first1 = Marc | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field |journal = [[Cultural Anthropology (journal)|Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | page = 407 | jstor = 08867356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' (&quot;fieldwork&quot;) and developing with the center founded by [[Marc AugÃ©]] (''[[Ã‰cole des hautes Ã©tudes en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).

Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael M. J. (2003) ''Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agricultural science''' (or '''agriscience''' for short&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Agriscience {{!}} Meaning &amp; Definition for UK English |encyclopedia=[[Oxford Dictionary of English]] |url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/agriscience|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220220064428/https://www.lexico.com/definition/agriscience|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 February 2022|access-date=2022-02-20 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] via [[Lexico]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a broad multidisciplinary field of [[biology]] that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social science]]s that are used in the practice and understanding of [[agriculture]]. Professionals of the agricultural science are called agricultural scientists or [[agriculturists]].

==History==
{{Main|History of agricultural science}}

In the 18th century, [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]] conducted experiments on the use of [[gypsum]] (hydrated [[calcium sulphate]]) as a [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JB 1840&quot;&gt;John Armstrong, Jesse Buel. ''A Treatise on Agriculture, The Present Condition of the Art Abroad and at Home, and the Theory and Practice of Husbandry.

Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[Developing country|developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s.

As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.

New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[Religion and Agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.--&gt;

==Scope==
Agriculture, agricultural science, and agronomy are closely related. However, they cover different concepts:
*Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.
*[[Agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based crops.

==Soil forming factors and soil degradation==
Agricultural sciences include research and development on:&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosso 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Bosso | first=Thelma | title=Agricultural Science | publisher=Callisto Reference | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-63239-058-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boucher 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Boucher | first=Jude | title=Agricultural Science and Management | publisher=Callisto Reference  | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-63239-965-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[Drought tolerance|drought-resistant]] crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)
* Minimizing the effects of pests ([[weed]]s, [[insect]]s, [[pathogen]]s, [[mollusk]]s, [[nematode]]s) on crop or animal production systems.
* Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]])
* [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling
* Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed [[subsistence agriculture]], which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of [[industrial agriculture]], which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems.
* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil, the US and the EU.
* Various sciences relating to agricultural resources and the environment (e.g. soil science, agroclimatology); biology of agricultural crops and animals (e.g. crop science, animal science and their included sciences, e.g. ruminant nutrition, farm animal welfare); such fields as agricultural economics and rural sociology; various disciplines encompassed in [[agricultural engineering]].

Because of its purpose, the alchemists' quest is always strictly linked to the religious doctrine of redemption current in each civilization where alchemy is practised.&lt;br /&gt; In the Western world alchemy presented itself at its advent as a sacred art. But when, after a long detour via Byzantium and Islamic culture, it came back again to Europe in the twelfth century, adepts designated themselves philosophers.

Islamic and European alchemists developed a basic set of [[laboratory techniques]], theories, and terms, some of which are still in use today.

In Europe, the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|12th-century translations]] of [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic works on science]] and the [[Recovery of Aristotle|rediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy]] gave birth to a flourishing tradition of Latin alchemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot; /&gt; This late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role in the development of [[Early modern era|early modern]] science (particularly [[History of chemistry|chemistry]] and [[History of medicine|medicine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor-last=Eddy |editor-first=Matthew Daniel |editor2-last=Mauskopf |editor2-first=Seymour |editor3-last=Newman |editor3-first=William R. |display-editors=0 |ref={{harvid|''CKEMW''|2014}} |title=Chemical Knowledge in the Early Modern World |journal=Osiris |volume=29 |pages=1â€“15 |date=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/6629576 |last1=Newman |first1=William R. |last2=Mauskopf |first2=Seymour H. |last3=Eddy |first3=Matthew Daniel |pmid=26103744 |doi=10.1086/678110 |s2cid=29035688 |access-date=23 August 2014 |archive-date=30 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220730040038/https://www.academia.edu/6629576 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its [[exoteric]] practical applications and its [[esoteric]] spiritual aspects, despite criticisms by scholars such as [[Eric John Holmyard|Eric J. Holmyard]] and [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] that they should be understood as complementary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FRAALC97&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|von Franz|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is pursued by [[History of the physical sciences|historians of the physical sciences]], who examine the subject in terms of [[History of chemistry|early chemistry]], [[History of medicine|medicine]], and [[charlatanism]], and the [[philosophical]] and [[Religion|religious]] contexts in which these events occurred. The latter interests historians of [[esotericism]], [[History of psychology|psychologists]], and some philosophers and [[Spirituality|spiritualists]]. The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts.

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Etymology of chemistry}}
The word alchemy comes from [[old French]] ''alquemie'', ''alkimie'', used in [[Medieval Latin]] as {{lang|la-x-medieval|alchymia}}. This name was itself adopted from the [[Arabic]] word {{transliteration|ar|al-kÄ«miyÄ}} ({{lang|ar|Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙŠÙ…ÙŠØ§Ø¡}}). The Arabic {{transliteration|ar|al-kÄ«miyÄ}} in turn was a borrowing of the [[Late Greek]] term ''khÄ“meÃ­a'' ({{lang|el|Ï‡Î·Î¼ÎµÎ¯Î±}}), also spelled ''khumeia'' ({{lang|el|Ï‡Ï…Î¼ÎµÎ¯Î±}}) and ''khÄ“mÃ­a'' ({{lang|el|Ï‡Î·Î¼Î¯Î±}}), with ''[[al-]]'' being the Arabic definite article 'the'.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;{{OED|alchemy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together this association can be interpreted as 'the process of [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|transmutation]] by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form'. Several etymologies have been proposed for the Greek term. The first was proposed by Zosimos of Panopolis (3rdâ€“4th centuries), who derived it from the name of a book, the ''Khemeu.''&lt;ref&gt;George Syncellus, ''Chronography'', 18â€“9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the ancient definitions of alchemy in ancient Greek and Syriac texts see Matteo Martelli. 2014. &quot;The Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy and the Enochian Tradition&quot;, In: DuprÃ© S. (eds) ''Laboratories of Art'', Springer, Cham.&lt;/ref&gt; Hermann Diels argued in 1914 that it rather derived from Ï‡ÏÎ¼Î±,&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Diels, ''Antike Technik'', Leipzig: Teubner, 1914, p. 108-109. [[iarchive:bub gb LoEAAAAAMAAJ/page/n125/mode/2up|Read online]]&lt;/ref&gt; used to describe metallic objects formed by casting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=xeiw&amp;la=greek#lexicon |title=Greek Word Study Tool |website=perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=14 February 2020|archive-date=7 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201107084344/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=xeiw&amp;la=greek#lexicon|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others trace its roots to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name ''{{lang|egy-Latn|kÄ“me}}'' (hieroglyphic ð“†Žð“…“ð“ð“Š– ''{{lang|egy-Latn|khmi}}'' ), meaning 'black earth', which refers to the fertile and [[wikt:auriferous|auriferous]] soil of the Nile valley, as opposed to red desert sand.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot; /&gt; According to the Egyptologist [[Wallis Budge]], the Arabic word ''{{lang|ar-Latn|al-kÄ«miya}}Ê¾'' actually means &quot;the Egyptian [science]&quot;, borrowing from the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] word for &quot;Egypt&quot;, ''{{lang|cop-Latn|kÄ“me}}'' (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval [[Bohairic]] dialect of Coptic, ''{{lang|cop-Latn|khÄ“me}}''). This Coptic word derives from [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|kmá»‰}}'', itself from ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|kmt}}''. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour &quot;black&quot; (Egypt was the &quot;black Land&quot;, by contrast with the &quot;red Land&quot;, the surrounding desert).

== History ==
Alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be mostly independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in China; [[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]], centered on the [[Indian subcontinent]]; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and whose center shifted over the millennia from [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]] to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], and finally [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]] and Indian alchemy with the [[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths]]. In contrast, Western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various [[Western religion]]s. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

The start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and [[Hellenistic Egypt]], where the city of [[Alexandria]] was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods.&lt;ref&gt;''New Scientist'', 24â€“31 December 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Following the work of AndrÃ©-Jean FestugiÃ¨re, modern scholars see alchemical practice in the Roman Empire as originating from the Egyptian goldsmith's art, Greek philosophy and different religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=FestugiÃ¨re |first=AndrÃ©-Jean |title=La rÃ©vÃ©lation d'HermÃ¨s TrismÃ©giste, Vol.1 |publisher=Les Belles Lettres |year=2006 |location=Paris |pages=218â€“219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracing the origins of the alchemical art in Egypt is complicated by the [[pseudepigraphic]] nature of texts from the Greek alchemical corpus.

Zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors, such as [[Mary the Jewess]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |last=Patai |first=Raphael |title=The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LorvA_5Ex_UC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-00642-0 |pages=60â€“91}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pseudo-Democritus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Martelli, The Four Books of Pseudo-Democritus&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martelli |first1=Matteo |title=The Four Books of Pseudo-Democritus |date=2014 |publisher=Maney |location=Leeds}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Agathodaemon (alchemist)|Agathodaimon]], but very little is known about any of these authors. The most complete of their works, The ''Four Books'' of [[Pseudo-Democritus]], were probably written in the first century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martelli, The Four Books of Pseudo-Democritus&quot; /&gt;

Recent scholarship tends to emphasize the testimony of Zosimus, who traced the alchemical arts back to Egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martelli |first1=Matteo |title=L'alchimista antico |date=2019 |publisher=Editrice Bibliografica |isbn=978-88-7075-979-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grimes |first=Shannon |url=https://rubedo.press/becoming-gold |title=Becoming Gold |publisher=Rubedo Press |year=2018 |location=Auckland|access-date=12 February 2020|archive-date=12 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212203123/https://rubedo.press/becoming-gold|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dufault |first1=Olivier |title=Early Greek Alchemy, Patronage and Innovation in Late Antiquity |date=2019 |publisher=California Classical Studies |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-1-939926-12-8 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2ks0g83x |access-date=12 February 2020 |archive-date=12 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212203119/https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2ks0g83x |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of Greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dufault |first1=Olivier |s2cid=10823051 |title=Transmutation Theory in the Greek Alchemical Corpus |journal=Ambix |year=2015 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=215â€“244 |doi=10.1179/1745823415Y.0000000003 |pmid=26307909 |url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/download/hc:24472/CONTENT/dufault-transmutation-theory-in-the-greek-alchemical-corpus.pdf/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://hcommons.org/deposits/download/hc:24472/CONTENT/dufault-transmutation-theory-in-the-greek-alchemical-corpus.pdf/ |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimos of Panopolis wrote in the ''Final Abstinence'' (also known as the &quot;Final Count&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;The title of the Ï„ÎµÎ»ÎµÏ…Ï„Î±á½¶Î± á¼€Ï€Î¿Ï‡Î® is traditionally translated as the &quot;Final Count&quot;.

Since Zosimos also called the demons &quot;the guardians of places&quot; ({{lang|el|Î¿á¼± ÎºÎ±Ï„á½° Ï„ÏŒÏ€Î¿Î½ á¼”Ï†Î¿ÏÎ¿Î¹}}, {{transliteration|el|hoi katÃ  tÃ³pon Ã©phoroi}}) and those who offered them sacrifices &quot;priests&quot; ({{lang|el|á¼±ÎµÏÎ­Î±}}, {{transliteration|el|hierÃ©a}}), it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of Egypt and their priests. While critical of the kind of alchemy he associated with the Egyptian priests and their followers, Zosimos nonetheless saw the tradition's recent past as rooted in the rites of the Egyptian temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dufault |first=Olivier |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2ks0g83x |title=Early Greek Alchemy, Patronage and Innovation |publisher=California Classical Studies |year=2019 |location=Berkeley |pages=118â€“141 |isbn=978-1-939926-12-8|access-date=12 February 2020|archive-date=12 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212203119/https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2ks0g83x|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mythology''' â€“ Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]] where it was the domain of the priestly class, though there is little to no evidence for his assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Garfinkel |first=Harold |title=Ethnomethodological Studies of Work |publisher=Routledge &amp;Kegan Paul |year=1986 |page=127 |isbn=978-0-415-11965-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy. 'Roman and European Mythologies'. University of Chicago Press, 1992. pp. 211â€“213&lt;/ref&gt; These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets, [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Jason]], and many others.

The central figure in the mythology of alchemy is [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (or Thrice-Great Hermes). His name is derived from the [[deity|god]] [[Thoth]] and his Greek counterpart [[Hermes]].&lt;ref&gt;A survey of the literary and archaeological evidence for the background of Hermes Trismegistus in the Greek Hermes and the Egyptian Thoth may be found in Bull, Christian H. 2018. ''The Tradition of Hermes Trismegistus: The Egyptian Priestly Figure as a Teacher of Hellenized Wisdom''. Leiden: Brill, pp. 33-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Hermes and his [[caduceus]] or serpent-staff, were among alchemy's principal symbols. According to [[Clement of Alexandria]], he wrote what were called the &quot;forty-two books of Hermes&quot;, covering all fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book VI/Chapter IV.|Clement, ''Stromata'', vi. 4.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hermetica]]'' of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the [[hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] by its early practitioners. These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.

'''Technology''' â€“ The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of [[metallurgy]], extending back to 3500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many writings were lost when the [[Roman emperor]] [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of alchemical books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Partington |first=James Riddick |title=A Short History of Chemistry |url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofch0000part_q6h4|url-access=registration |year=1989 |page=[https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofch0000part_q6h4/page/20 20] |isbn=978-0-486-65977-0 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (AD&amp;nbsp;292). Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the [[Stockholm papyrus]] and the [[Leyden papyrus X]]. Dating from AD&amp;nbsp;250â€“300, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;Caley, E. R. (1927) &quot;The Stockholm Papyrus : An English Translation with brief notes&quot; Journal of Chemical Education IV:8 : 979-1002.&lt;/ref&gt; These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of [[Bolus of Mendes]] (or [[Pseudo-Democritus]]), which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the [[classical elements]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13&quot;&gt;''A History of Chemistry'', Bensaude-Vincent, Isabelle Stengers, ''Harvard University Press'', 1996, '''p13'''&lt;/ref&gt; Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy''' â€“ Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of [[Pythagoreanism]], [[Platonism]], [[Stoicism]] and [[Gnosticism]] which formed the origin of alchemy's character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13&quot; /&gt; An important example of alchemy's roots in Greek philosophy, originated by [[Empedocles]] and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]]. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lindsay, Jack |title=The Origins of Alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt |location=London |publisher=Muller |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-389-01006-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/trent_0116301348557/page/16 16] |url=https://archive.org/details/trent_0116301348557/page/16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are; &quot;...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Titus |last=Burckhardt | author-link=Titus Burckhardt |title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul |location=Baltimore |publisher=Penguin |year=1967 |page=66 |others=Trans. William Stoddart |isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.

Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging [[Christianity]]. [[Lactantius]] believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth. [[Augustine of Hippo|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]] later affirmed this in the 4th and 5th centuries, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, Philip Ashley. ''Isaac Newton and the Transmutation of Alchemy: An Alternative View of the Scientific Revolution.'' 2009. p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Pagan, Christian, and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period.

Most of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms, such as [[Moses of Alexandria|Moses]], Isis, [[Cleopatra the Alchemist|Cleopatra]], [[Pseudo-Democritus|Democritus]], and [[Ostanes]]. Others authors such as Komarios, and [[Chymes]], we only know through fragments of text. After AD&amp;nbsp;400, Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;F. Sherwood Taylor. ''Alchemists, Founders of Modern Chemistry.'' p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and early modern chemistry: papers from Ambix.'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time that [[Khalid Ibn Yazid]] sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world, facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Oleg Grabar. ''Late antiquity: a guide to the postclassical world.'' p. 284â€“285&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek alchemy was preserved in medieval [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts after the fall of [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], and yet historians have only relatively recently begun to pay attention to the study and development of Greek alchemy in the Byzantine period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roberts |first1=Alexandre M. |title=Framing a Middle Byzantine Alchemical Codex |journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers |date=2019 |volume=73 |pages=69â€“70 |url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:31587/ |access-date=8 February 2021 |archive-date=18 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118131404/https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:31587/ |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th-century [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Persian chemist]] and [[Medicine in medieval Islam|physician]] [[AbÅ« RayhÄn BÄ«rÅ«nÄ«]], who visited Gujarat as part of the court of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], reported that they
{{blockquote|have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them, which in [[Sanskrit]] is called [[Rasayana|RasÄyana]] and in Persian [[RasavÄtam]]. It means the art of obtaining/manipulating ''Rasa'': nectar, mercury, and juice. This art was restricted to certain operations, metals, drugs, compounds, and medicines, many of which have mercury as their core element. Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age.}}
The goals of alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body (Sanskrit ''divya-deham'') and immortality while still embodied (Sanskrit ''jÄ«van-mukti''). Sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur, that are homologized with the semen of the god Åšiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess DevÄ«.

Some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of [[Matsyendranath]]. Other early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise ''KalyÄá¹‡akÄrakam'' of UgrÄditya, written in South India in the early 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meulenbeld |first1=G.

Two famous early Indian alchemical authors were [[Nagarjuna (metallurgist)|NÄgÄrjuna Siddha]] and NityanÄtha Siddha. NÄgÄrjuna Siddha was a Buddhist monk. His book, ''Rasendramangalam'', is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine. NityanÄtha Siddha wrote ''RasaratnÄkara'', also a highly influential work. In Sanskrit, ''rasa'' translates to &quot;mercury&quot;, and NÄgÄrjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://univie.academia.edu/DominikWujastyk/Papers/152766/ |last=Wujastyk |first=Dominik |year=1984 |title=An Alchemical Ghost: The RasaratnÄkara of NÄgarjuna |journal=Ambix |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=70â€“83 |doi=10.1179/amb.1984.31.2.70 |pmid=11615977 |access-date=28 December 2017 |archive-date=11 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200511080759/https://www.academia.edu/221269/An_Alchemical_Ghost_The_Rasaratn%C4%81kara_by_N%C4%81g%C4%81rjuna |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic world ===
{{Main|Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam}}
[[File:Al-Jaahith - African Arab Naturalist - Basra - al jahiz.jpg|thumb|upright|15th-century artistic impression of [[JÄbir ibn HayyÄn|Jabir ibn Hayyan]] (Geber), Codici Ashburnhamiani 1166, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Florence]]

After [[the Fall of the Roman Empire|the fall of the Roman Empire]], the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World. Much more is known about [[Islam]]ic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Titus |last=Burckhardt | author-link=Titus Burckhardt |title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul |location=Baltimore |publisher=Penguin |year=1967 |page=46 |others=Trans. William Stoddart |isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''alchemy'' itself was derived from the Arabic word ''al-kÄ«miyÄ'' (Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙŠÙ…ÙŠØ§Ø¡). The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. [[Plato]]nic and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations and scholarship.

In the late ninth and early tenth centuries, the Arabic works attributed to [[JÄbir ibn HayyÄn]] (Latinized as &quot;Geber&quot; or &quot;Geberus&quot;) introduced a new approach to alchemy. [[Paul Kraus (Arabist)|Paul Kraus]], who wrote the standard reference work on Jabir, put it as follows:

{{blockquote|To form an idea of the historical place of Jabir's alchemy and to tackle the problem of its sources, it is advisable to compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature in the [[Greek language]]. One knows in which miserable state this literature reached us. Collected by [[Byzantine science|Byzantine scientists]] from the tenth century, the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments, going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages.

The efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results, and the later researchers, among them in particular Mrs. Hammer-Jensen, Tannery, Lagercrantz, von Lippmann, Reitzenstein, Ruska, Bidez, FestugiÃ¨re and others, could make clear only few points of detail ....

The study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging. An even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory: even the supposedly technical writings, in the state where we find them today, are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation.

It is different with Jabir's alchemy. The relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati, the methodical classification of the substances, mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the Greek texts. The theory on which Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity. More than with the other Arab authors, one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching, between the ''[[Ilm (Arabic)|'ilm]]'' and the ''amal''.

Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir. Jabir's ultimate goal was ''[[Takwin]]'', the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analysed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of ''hotness'', ''coldness'', ''dryness'', and ''moistness''.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29 /&gt; According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29&gt;{{cite book |first=Titus |last=Burckhardt | author-link=Titus Burckhardt |title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul |location=Baltimore |publisher=Penguin |year=1967 |page=29 |others=Trans. William Stoddart |isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this reasoning, the search for the [[philosopher's stone]] was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate [[numerology]] whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties.

The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir. His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five [[classical element]]s ([[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[Water (classical element)|water]]) in addition to two [[chemical element]]s representing the metals: [[Sulfur|sulphur]], &quot;the stone which burns&quot;, which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties.{{dubious|date=January 2021}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] giving solidity.&lt;ref name=&quot;r8&quot;&gt;Strathern, Paul.

From the 9th to 14th centuries, alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists, including [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]],&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein-Frank (2001), &quot;Al-Kindi&quot;, in [[Oliver Leaman]] &amp; [[Hossein Nasr]], ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 174.

{{Main|Chinese alchemy}}
Researchers have found evidence that Chinese alchemists and philosophers discovered complex mathematical phenomena that were shared with Arab alchemists during the medieval period. Discovered in BC China, the &quot;magic square of three&quot; was propagated to followers of [[Jabir ibn Hayyan|AbÅ« MÅ«sÄ JÄbir ibn á¸¤ayyÄn]] at some point over the proceeding several hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Needham |first=Joseph |title=Theoretical Influences of China on Arabic Alchemy |publisher=UC Biblioteca Geral 1 |year=1987 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commonalities shared between the two alchemical schools of thought include discrete naming for ingredients and heavy influence from the natural elements. The silk road provided a clear path for the exchange of goods, ideas, ingredients, religion, and many other aspects of life with which alchemy is intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Saliba |first=George |date=2008 |title=&quot;China and Islamic Civilization: Exchange of Techniques and Scientific Ideas&quot; |url=https://edspace.american.edu/silkroadjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/984/2017/09/China-and-Islamic-Civilization.pdf |website=American University |access-date=16 December 2022 |archive-date=23 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221223213548/https://edspace.american.edu/silkroadjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/984/2017/09/China-and-Islamic-Civilization.pdf |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Esoteric Taijitu.svg|thumb|upright|Taoist alchemists often use this alternate version of the [[taijitu]].]]
Whereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASOCA&quot;&gt;[Obed Simon Johnson, A Study of Chinese Alchemy, Shanghai, Commercial P, 1928. rpt. New York: Arno P, 1974.]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher's stone of European alchemists can be compared to the [[Elixir of life|Grand Elixir of Immortality]] sought by Chinese alchemists. In the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the [[Panacea (medicine)|universal panacea]]; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears.

As early as 317 AD, [[Ge Hong]] documented the use of metals, minerals, and elixirs in early Chinese medicine. Hong identified three ancient Chinese documents, titled ''Scripture of Great Clarity, Scripture of the Nine Elixirs'', and ''Scripture of the Golden Liquor,'' as texts containing fundamental alchemical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pregadio |first=Fabrizio |title=Great Clarity: Daoism and Alchemy in Early Medieval China |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8047-6773-6 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also described alchemy, along with meditation, as the sole spiritual practices that could allow one to gain immortality or to transcend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pregadio |first=Fabrizio |title=Great Clarity: Daoism and Alchemy in Early Medieval China |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8047-6773-6 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''Inner Chapters of the Book of the Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature'' (317 AD), Hong argued that alchemical solutions such as elixirs were preferable to traditional medicinal treatment due to the spiritual protection they could provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pregadio |first=Fabrizio |title=Great Clarity: Daoism and Alchemy in Early Medieval China |publisher=Standford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8047-6773-6 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the centuries following Ge Hong's death, the emphasis placed on alchemy as a spiritual practice among Chinese [[Taoism|Daoists]] was reduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pregadio |first=Fabrizio |title=Great Clarity: Daoism and Alchemy in Early Medieval China |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8047-6773-6 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 499 AD, [[Tao Hongjing]] refuted Hong's statement that alchemy is as important a spiritual practice as Shangqing meditation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While Hongjing did not deny the power of alchemical elixirs to grant immortality or provide divine protection, he ultimately found the ''Scripture of the Nine Elixirs'' to be ambiguous and spiritually unfulfilling, aiming to implement more accessible practising techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pregadio |first=Fabrizio |title=Great Clarity: Daoism and Alchemy in Early Medieval China |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8047-6773-6 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 700s, [[Neidan]] (also known as internal alchemy) was adopted by Daoists as a new form of alchemy. Neidan emphasized appeasing the inner gods that inhabit the human body by practising alchemy with compounds found in the body, rather than the mixing of natural resources that was emphasized in early Dao alchemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pregadio |first=Fabrizio |date=2021 |title=The Alchemical Body in Daoism |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/5/article/782220 |journal=Journal of Daoist Studies |volume=14 |issue=14 |pages=99â€“127 |doi=10.1353/dao.2021.0003 |s2cid=228176118 |issn=1941-5524}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, saliva was often considered nourishment for the inner gods and did not require any conscious alchemical reaction to produce. The inner gods were not thought of as physical presences occupying each person, but rather a collection of deities that are each said to represent and protect a specific body part or region.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; Although those who practised Neidan prioritized meditation over external alchemical strategies, many of the same elixirs and constituents from previous Daoist alchemical schools of thought continued to be utilized in tandem with meditation. Eternal life remained a consideration for Neidan alchemists, as it was believed that one would become immortal if an inner god were to be immortalized within them through spiritual fulfilment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

[[Black powder]] may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a [[potion]] for eternal life. Described in 9th-century texts{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} and used in [[fireworks]] in China by the 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2024-03-29 |title=Gunpowder {{!}} Facts, History, &amp; Definition {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/gunpowder |access-date=2024-04-18 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was used in [[cannon]]s by 1290.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} From China, the use of [[gunpowder]] spread to Japan, the [[Mongol]]s, the Muslim world, and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century.

Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoist]] forms of [[traditional Chinese medicine]], such as [[Acupuncture]] and [[Moxibustion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ASOCA&quot; /&gt; In the early [[Song dynasty]], followers of this Taoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest [[cinnabar|mercuric sulfide]], which, though tolerable in low levels, led many to suicide.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favour of external sources{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} mastering of the [[qi]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} etc.) Chinese alchemy was introduced to the West by [[Obed Simon Johnson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ASOCA&quot; /&gt;

The introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144, with the completion of [[Robert of Chester]]'s translation of the {{lang|la|[[Liber de compositione alchemiae]]}} (&quot;Book on the Composition of Alchemy&quot;) from an Arabic work attributed to [[Khalid ibn Yazid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moureau |first1=SÃ©bastien |year=2020 |title=Min al-kÄ«miyÄÊ¾ ad alchimiam.

The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century [[Toledo, Spain]], through contributors like [[Gerard of Cremona]] and [[Adelard of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=105â€“108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of the time included the [[Turba Philosophorum]], and the works of [[Avicenna]] and [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]]. These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent. Alcohol, [[carboy]], [[elixir]], and [[athanor]] are examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought. The 11th-century [[Anselm of Canterbury|St&amp;nbsp;Anselm]] put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context. In the early 12th century, [[Peter Abelard]] followed Anselm's work, laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West. In the early 13th century, [[Robert Grosseteste]] used Abelard's methods of analysis and added the use of observation, experimentation, and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations. Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.&lt;ref name=hollister294f&gt;{{cite book |author=Hollister, C.

Through much of the 12th and 13th centuries, alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered on translations, and new Latin contributions were not made. The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists. In the 13th century, [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Roger Bacon]] were the most notable of these, their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms.&lt;ref&gt;John Read. ''From Alchemy to Chemistry''. 1995 p.90&lt;/ref&gt; Albertus Magnus, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], is known to have written works such as the ''Book of Minerals'' where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like [[Hermes Trismegistus]], [[pseudo-Democritus]] and unnamed alchemists of his time. Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals. From the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century, more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Weisheipl. ''Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays.'' PIMS. 1980. p.187-202&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert's student [[Thomas Aquinas]].

Roger Bacon, a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan friar]] who wrote on a wide variety of topics including [[optics]], [[comparative linguistics]], and medicine, composed his ''[[Opus Majus|Great Work]]'' ({{lang-la|Opus Majus}}) for {{nowrap|[[Pope Clement IV]]}} as part of a project towards rebuilding the [[medieval university]] curriculum to include the new learning of his time. While alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic, he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy's connections to [[soteriology]] and Christian theology. Bacon's writings integrated morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life. His correspondence with Clement highlighted this, noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Brehm. &quot;Roger Bacon's Place in the History of Alchemy.&quot; ''Ambix.'' Vol. 23, Part I, March 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres. He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time. The practical confirmed the theoretical, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=120â€“121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later European legend, he became an archmage. In particular, along with Albertus Magnus, he was credited with the forging of a [[brazen head]] capable of answering its owner's questions.

Soon after Bacon, the influential work of [[Pseudo-Geber]] (sometimes identified as [[Paul of Taranto]]) appeared. His ''Summa Perfectionis'' remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=134â€“141}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the [[soul|human soul]]). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded [[jargon]] set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practised their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made [[observation]]s and [[theory|theories]] about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Titus |last=Burckhardt | author-link=Titus Burckhardt |title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul |location=Baltimore |publisher=Penguin |year=1967 |page=149 |others=Trans.

In the 14th century, alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars. Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' University of Chicago Press, 2007. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante]], [[Piers Plowman]], and [[Chaucer]] all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars.

Boydell &amp; Brewer. 2010. p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic Inquisitor General [[Nicholas Eymerich]]'s ''[[Directorium Inquisitorum]]'', written in 1376, associated alchemy with the performance of demonic rituals, which Eymerich differentiated from magic performed in accordance with scripture.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tarrant |first=Neil |date=2018 |title=Between Aquinas and Eymerich: The Roman Inquisition's Use of Dominican Thought in the Censorship of Alchemy |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00026980.2018.1512779 |journal=Ambix |language=en |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=210â€“231 |doi=10.1080/00026980.2018.1512779 |pmid=30134775 |s2cid=52070616 |issn=0002-6980 |access-date=16 December 2022 |archive-date=16 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221216012751/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00026980.2018.1512779 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not, however, lead to any change in the Inquisition's monitoring or prosecution of alchemists.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; In 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals (although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically, and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV).&lt;ref&gt;D.

During the [[Renaissance]], Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy. The dawn of medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed.

In the late 15th century, [[Marsilio Ficino]] translated the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] and the works of Plato into Latin. These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent. [[Renaissance Humanism]] and [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]] guided alchemists away from [[physics]] to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel.

Esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism, fusing it with magic, astrology, and Christian cabala.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Forshaw. '&quot;Chemistry, That Starry Science&quot; â€“ Early Modern Conjunctions of Astrology and Alchemy' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Forshaw, 'Cabala Chymica or Chemia Cabalistica â€“ Early Modern Alchemists and Cabala' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; A key figure in this development was German [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486â€“1535), who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists. In his ''De Occulta Philosophia'', he attempted to merge [[Kabbalah]], Hermeticism, and alchemy. He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee. ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition.'' Cornell University Press. 2008. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. ''The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2008 p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paracelsus]] (Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493â€“1541) cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of Agrippa's occultism and moving away from [[chrysopoeia]]. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote, &quot;Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver.

His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm.

[[John Dee]] (13 July 1527 â€“ December 1608) followed Agrippa's occult tradition.

Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher's stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels.&lt;ref&gt;

Entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe. Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining, medical services, and the production of chemicals, medicines, metals, and gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the late 16th century, famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague, including Dee and his associate [[Edward Kelley]].

Although most of these appointments were legitimate, the trend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance. ''BetrÃ¼ger'' would use sleight of hand, or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage. Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as [[Michael Maier]] and [[Heinrich Khunrath]] wrote about fraudulent transmutations, distinguishing themselves from the [[con artist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.171&lt;/ref&gt; False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.

The terms &quot;chemia&quot; and &quot;alchemia&quot; were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day. There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic. For example, [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546â€“1601), an alchemist better known for his [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] investigations, had a laboratory built at his [[Uraniborg]] observatory/research institute. [[MichaÅ‚ SÄ™dziwÃ³j|Michael Sendivogius]] (''MichaÅ‚ SÄ™dziwÃ³j'', 1566â€“1636), a [[Poland|Polish]] alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling [[oxygen]] in a lab sometime around 1600. Sendivogious taught his technique to [[Cornelius Drebbel]] who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine. [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics. Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]]. Their Hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.

=== Later modern period ===
[[File:The Shannon Portrait of the Hon Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Boyle]]]]
[[File:Alchemist.png|thumb|right|An alchemist, pictured in Charles Mackay's ''[[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]'']]
The decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for &quot;ancient wisdom&quot;. Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century. As late as 1781 [[James Price (chemist)|James Price]] claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold. Early modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories, practices, and purposes: &quot;Scholastic and anti-Aristotelian, Paracelsian and anti-Paracelsian, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, mechanistic, vitalistic, and moreâ€”plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alchemy Restored&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Principe |first1=Lawrence M |year=2011 |title=Alchemy Restored |journal=Isis |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=305â€“12 |doi=10.1086/660139 |pmid=21874690 |s2cid=23581980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Boyle]] (1627â€“1691) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data. Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pilkington, Roger |title=Robert Boyle: Father of Chemistry |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=1959 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries and ideas of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] and [[John Dalton]].

Beginning around 1720, a rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between &quot;alchemy&quot; and &quot;chemistry&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmanPrincipe2002p37&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Newman|Principe|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp386&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1740s, &quot;alchemy&quot; was now restricted to the realm of gold making, leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans, and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alchemy Restored&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp386&quot; /&gt; In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected, academic writers during the 18th-century scientific Enlightenment attempted to divorce and separate the &quot;new&quot; chemistry from the &quot;old&quot; practices of alchemy. This move was mostly successful, and the consequences of this continued into the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanpp386â€“7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|pp=386â€“7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occult revival of the early 19th century, alchemy received new attention as an occult science.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp387&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KripalShuck2005p27&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kripal|Shuck|2005|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The esoteric or occultist school that arose during the 19th century held the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, less than as a practical tradition or protoscience.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmanPrincipe2002p37&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliade|1994|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp388&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation claimed that the obscure language of the alchemical texts, which 19th century practitioners were not always able to decipher, were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp388&quot; /&gt;

Two seminal figures during this period were [[Mary Anne Atwood]] and [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (general)|Ethan Allen Hitchcock]], who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy. Both rebuffed the growing successes of chemistry, developing a completely esoteric view of alchemy. Atwood wrote: &quot;No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp391&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rutkin2001p143&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rutkin|2001|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atwood's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Hitchcock, in his ''Remarks Upon Alchymists'' (1855) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state. In 1845, Baron [[Carl Reichenbach]], published his studies on [[Odic force]], a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Merkur. ''Gnosis: An Esoteric Tradition of Mystical Visions and Unions.'' SUNY Press. 1993 p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[Louis Cattiaux]] published the Message RetrouvÃ©, a work that was at once philosophical, mystical and highly influenced by alchemy. In his lineage, many researchers, including Emmanuel and Charles d'Hooghvorst, are updating alchemical studies in France and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Croire l'Incroyable.

=== Women ===
Several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy. [[Michael Maier]] names four women who were able to make the philosophers' stone: [[Mary the Jewess]], [[Cleopatra the Alchemist]], [[Medera]], and [[Paphnutia the Virgin|Taphnutia]].&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book.'' p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimos' sister Theosebia (later known as Euthica the Arab) and [[Isis the Prophetess]] also played roles in early alchemical texts.

The first alchemist whose name we know was Mary the Jewess ({{circa|200 A.D.}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women in Chemistry: Their Changing Roles from Alchemical Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century |author1=Rayner-Canham, M |author2=Rayner-Canham, G |publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-941901-27-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/womeninchemistry0000rayn/page/2 2â€“4] |url=https://archive.org/details/womeninchemistry0000rayn/page/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early sources claim that Mary (or Maria) devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes.

Some women known for their interest in alchemy were [[Catherine de' Medici]], the Queen of France, and [[Marie de' Medici]], the following Queen of France, who carried out experiments in her personal laboratory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Also, [[Isabella d'Este]], the Marchioness of Mantua, made perfumes herself to serve as gifts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Due to the proliferation in alchemical literature of [[pseudepigrapha]] and anonymous works, however, it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women. This contributed to a broader pattern in which male authors credited prominent noblewomen for beauty products with the purpose of appealing to a female audience. For example, in {{lang|it|Ricettario galante}} (&quot;Gallant Recipe-Book&quot;), the distillation of lemons and roses was attributed to [[Elisabetta Gonzaga]], the duchess of Urbino.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; In the same book, [[Isabella d'Aragona]], the daughter of Alfonso II of Naples, is accredited for recipes involving [[alum]] and mercury.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; [[Ippolita Maria Sforza]] is even referred to in an anonymous manuscript about a hand lotion created with rose powder and crushed bones.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

As the sixteenth century went on, scientific culture flourished and people began collecting &quot;secrets&quot;. During this period &quot;secrets&quot; referred to experiments, and the most coveted ones were not those which were bizarre, but the ones which had been proven to yield the desired outcome.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;  In this period, the only book of secrets ascribed to a woman was {{lang|it|I secreti della signora Isabella Cortese}} ('The Secrets of Signora Isabella Cortese').&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; This book contained information on how to turn base metals into gold, medicine, and cosmetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; However, it is rumoured that a man, [[Girolamo Ruscelli]], was the real author and only used a female voice to attract female readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sacco |first=Francesco G. |date=March 2016 |title=Meredith K.

University of Chicago Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As the language of the alchemists is analysed, historians are becoming more aware of the connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the evolution of science and [[philosophy]], the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[Kabbalah|kabbalism]], [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/exeseso/ |title=Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism.

Western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born. Concepts were imported from [[Neoplatonism]] and earlier Greek [[cosmology]]. As such, the [[classical element]]s appear in alchemical writings, as do the seven [[classical planet]]s and the corresponding seven [[metals of antiquity]]. Similarly, the gods of the [[List of Roman deities|Roman pantheon]] who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature. The concepts of [[prima materia]] and [[anima mundi]] are central to the theory of the [[philosopher's stone]].

== Modernity ==
Due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century diffusion of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of [[chemistry]], the general understanding of alchemy in the 19th-20th century was influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those focusing on the [[exoteric]], such as historians of science [[Lawrence M. Principe]] and [[William R. Newman]], have interpreted the '''decknamen''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Conniff. &quot;Alchemy May Not Have Been the Pseudoscience We All Thought It Was.&quot; [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/alchemy-may-not-been-pseudoscience-we-thought-it-was-180949430/ Smithsonian Magazine.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202131219/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/alchemy-may-not-been-pseudoscience-we-thought-it-was-180949430/ |date=2 February 2014 }} February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite end of the spectrum, focusing on the [[Western esotericism|esoteric]], scholars, such as [[Florin George CÄƒlian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calian |first=George |title=Alkimia Operativa and Alkimia Speculativa.

New interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated, sometimes merging in concepts from [[New Age]] or radical environmentalism movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups like the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism. Since the Victorian revival of alchemy, [[Occult|occultists]] reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice, involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Alchemy Restored&quot; /&gt; which has contributed to a merger of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and alchemy in popular thought.

=== Esoteric interpretations of historical texts ===
In the eyes of a variety of modern [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] and [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Neo-Hermetic]] practitioners, alchemy is primarily spiritual. In this interpretation, transmutation of [[lead]] into [[gold]] is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antoine Faivre 1995. p.96&quot;&gt;Antoine Faivre, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. ''Western esotericism and the science of religion.'' 1995. p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, early alchemists such as [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] ({{circa|300 AD}}) highlighted the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and early modern chemistry.'' The Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry. p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is held to have continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' hid a [[spiritual philosophy]]. In the [[Hermeticism|Neo-Hermeticist]] interpretation, both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal [[panacea]] are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state toward a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state, so the [[philosopher's stone]] then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist, the twin goal symbolized their evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are believed to have been written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works are supposed to contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.

In his 1766 ''Alchemical Catechism'', [[ThÃ©odore Henri de Tschudi]] suggested that the usage of the metals was symbolic:

{{blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver?
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.&lt;ref&gt;ThÃ©odore Henri de Tschudi. Hermetic Catechism in his ''L'Etoile Flamboyant ou la SociÃ©tÃ© des Franc-MaÃ§ons considerÃ©e sous tous les aspects.'' 1766. (A.E. Waite translation as found in ''The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus.'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

=== Psychology ===
[[Alchemical symbol|Alchemical symbolism]] has been important in analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]]. Jung was initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images but after being given a copy of ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'', a Chinese alchemical text translated by his friend [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]], he discovered a direct correlation or parallel between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner, symbolic images coming up in his patients' dreams, visions, or fantasies. He observed these alchemical images occurring during the psychic process of transformation, a process that Jung called &quot;[[individuation]]&quot;. Specifically, he regarded the conjuring up of images of [[philosopher's stone|gold or Lapis]] as symbolic expressions of the origin and goal of this &quot;process of individuation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung, C. G. 1944&quot;&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 {{ISBN|0-691-01831-6}}). London: Routledge. E.g. Â§&amp;nbsp;41, Â§&amp;nbsp;116, Â§&amp;nbsp;427, Â§&amp;nbsp;431, Â§&amp;nbsp;448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&quot; /&gt; Together with his alchemical ''mystica soror'' (mystical sister) Jungian Swiss analyst [[Marie-Louise von Franz]], Jung began collecting old alchemical texts, compiled a [[lexicon]] of key phrases with cross-references,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Stevens: ''On Jung.'' (A new and authoritiative introduction to Jung's life and thought), Penguin Books, London 1990, {{ISBN|0-14-012494-2}}, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and pored over them. The volumes of work he wrote shed new light onto understanding the art of [[transubstantiation]] and renewed alchemy's popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites are brought into contact and inner and outer, spirit and matter are reunited in the ''[[hieros gamos]]'', or divine marriage. His writings are influential in general [[psychology]], but especially to those who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams, symbols, and the unconscious archetypal forces ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]) that comprise all psychic life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&quot;&gt;[[Polly Young-Eisendrath]], Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Jung Preface to [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]]'s translation of the [[I Ching]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to the translation of [[Secret of the Golden Flower|The Secret of The Golden Flower]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Marie-Louise von Franz|von Franz]] and [[Carl Jung|Jung]] have contributed significantly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture. Among the volumes Jung wrote on alchemy, his magnum opus is Volume 14 of his Collected Works, ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]''.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}
Alchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment. ''Literary alchemy'' appears throughout the history of English literature from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=SzÃ¶nyi |first=GyÃ¶rgy E. |date=1 December 2012 |title=&quot;Contending with the Fretful Element&quot;: Shakespeare and the (Gendered) Great Chain of Being |journal=Gender Studies |language=de |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=1â€“22 |doi=10.2478/v10320-012-0025-6 |s2cid=143130101|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[J. K. Rowling]], and also the popular Japanese manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]''. Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus. In the 14th century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late Sir [[Terry Pratchett]]. Another literary work taking inspiration from the alchemical tradition is the 1988 novel ''[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]]'' by Brazilian writer [[Paulo Coelho]].

Visual artists have had a similar relationship with alchemy. While some used it as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work. Music was also present in the works of alchemists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1 June 1935 |title=Alchemy and Music |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/135967a0 |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=135 |issue=3423 |pages=967â€“968 |doi=10.1038/135967a0 |bibcode=1935Natur.135..967. |issn=1476-4687 |access-date=11 January 2024 |archive-date=11 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240111200919/https://www.nature.com/articles/135967a0 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to influence popular performers. In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and [[Paracelsianism|spagyric]] role in fantasy fiction, film, television, novels, comics and video games.

{{further|Nuclear transmutation}}
One goal of alchemy, the transmutation of base substances into gold, is now known to be impossible by means of traditional chemistry, but possible by other physical means. Although not financially worthwhile, [[Synthesis of precious metals#Gold|gold was synthesized]] in [[Particle accelerator|particle accelerators]] as early as 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Aleklett |first1=K. |last2=Morrissey |first2=D.

[[File:IAU 2006 General Assembly- Result of the IAU Resolution Votes (iau0603g).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A voting session is conducted in 2006 [[International Astronomical Union]]'s general assembly for determining a [[IAU definition of planet|new definition of a planet]]]]

An '''astronomer''' is a [[scientist]] in the field of [[astronomy]] who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of [[Earth]]. They observe [[astronomical object]]s such as [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[comet]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] â€“ in either [[observational astronomy|observational]] (by analyzing the data) or [[theoretical astronomy]]. Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include [[planetary science]], [[Sun|solar astronomy]], the [[Star formation|origin]] or [[stellar evolution|evolution of stars]], or the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]]. A related but distinct subject is [[physical cosmology]], which studies the [[Universe]] as a whole.

==Types==
Astronomers usually fall under either of two main types: [[observational astronomy|observational]] and [[theoretical astronomy|theoretical]]. Observational astronomers make direct [[observation]]s of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and analyze the data. In contrast, theoretical astronomers create and investigate [[Conceptual model|model]]s of things that cannot be observed. Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle, astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve, and die. They use this data to create models or [[simulation]]s to theorize how different celestial objects work.

Further subcategories under these two main [[branches of science|branches]] of astronomy include [[Planetary science|planetary astronomy]], [[galactic astronomy]], or [[physical cosmology]].

== Academic ==

[[History of astronomy|Historically]], astronomy was more concerned with the [[classification]] and description of [[phenomena]] in the sky, while [[astrophysics]] attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using [[Scientific law|physical laws]]. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms &quot;astronomer&quot; and &quot;astrophysicist&quot; are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[physics]] or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Becoming an Astronomer |access-date=29 March 2009 |publisher=NOAO | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403101540/http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html| archive-date= 3 April 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.

The [[American Astronomical Society]], which is the major organization of professional astronomers in [[North America]], has approximately 7,000 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, [[geology]], and [[engineering]], whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aas.org/ |title=American Astronomical Society Home |access-date=14 August 2009 |publisher=AAS| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090802044012/http://aas.org/|archive-date= 2 August 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/about/ |title=About IAU |access-date=14 August 2009 |publisher=IAU}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:å—å…¬æ‡·ä»åƒ.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of the Flemish astronomer [[Ferdinand Verbiest]] who became Head of the Mathematical Board and Director of the Observatory of the Chinese emperor in 1669]]
Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a [[telescope]] through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the [[light]] is added over time. Before CCDs, [[photographic plates]] were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers' time.

Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes [[planetarium]]s as a public service to encourage interest in the field.

Those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths, sciences and computing in high school. Taking courses that teach how to research, write, and present papers are also invaluable. In college/university most astronomers get a PhD in astronomy or physics.

== Amateur astronomers ==
{{main|Amateur astronomy}}
While there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers, the field is popular among [[amateurs]]. Most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host [[star party|star parties]]. The [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about.html |title=About Us |access-date=29 March 2009 |publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225074145/http://astrosociety.org/about.html| archive-date= 25 February 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any [[hobby]], most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to [[stargazing]] and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called &quot;armchair astronomers&quot; to the very ambitious, who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

Because of technical limitations of computer systems at the time it was invented, ASCII has just 128 [[code point]]s, of which only 95 are {{Pslink|printable characters}}, which severely limited its scope. Modern computer systems have evolved to use [[Unicode]], which has millions of code points, but the first 128 of these are the same as the ASCII set.

The [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) prefers the name '''US-ASCII''' for this character encoding.&lt;ref name=&quot;IANA_2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|website=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)|date=May 14, 2007|url=https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets|title=Character Sets|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
ASCII was developed in part from [[telegraph code]]. Its first commercial use was in the [[Teletype Model 33]] and the Teletype Model 35 as a seven-[[bit]] [[teleprinter]] code promoted by Bell data services.{{when|date=November 2021}} Work on the ASCII standard began in May 1961, with the first meeting of the American Standards Association's (ASA) (now the [[American National Standards Institute]] or ANSI) X3.2 subcommittee.

Originally based on the (modern) [[English alphabet]], ASCII encodes 128 specified [[character (computing)|characters]] into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart in this article.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC-4949&quot;&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Internet Security Glossary, Version 2 |date=August 2007 |author-first=R. |author-last=Shirley |rfc=4949 |access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-five of the encoded characters are printable: these include the digits ''0'' to ''9'', lowercase letters ''a'' to ''z'', uppercase letters ''A'' to ''Z'', and [[punctuation symbol]]s. In addition, the original ASCII specification included 33 non-printing [[control code]]s which originated with {{notatypo|[[Teletype Corporation#Teletype Corporation|Teletype model]]}}s; most of these are now obsolete,&lt;ref name=&quot;Maini_2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Maini |author-first=Anil Kumar |title=Digital Electronics: Principles, Devices and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQSpNAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |date=2007 |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |isbn=978-0-470-03214-5 |page=28 |quote=In addition, it defines codes for 33 nonprinting, mostly obsolete control characters that affect how the text is processed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a few are still commonly used, such as the [[carriage return]], [[line feed]], and [[Tab key#Tab characters|tab]] codes.

For example, lowercase ''[[i]]'' would be represented in the ASCII encoding by [[binary number|binary]] 1101001 = [[hexadecimal]] 69 (''i'' is the ninth letter) = [[decimal]] 105.

Despite being an American standard, ASCII does not have a code point for the [[Cent (currency)|cent]] (Â¢). It also does not support [[English terms with diacritical marks]] such as [[rÃ©sumÃ©]] and [[jalapeÃ±o]], or [[proper nouns]] with diacritical marks such as [[BeyoncÃ©]].

[[File:ASCII1963-infobox-paths.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|ASCII (1963). [[Control Pictures]] of equivalent controls are shown where they exist, or a grey dot otherwise.]]
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA), called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group (now [[INCITS]]). The ASA later became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|211}} and ultimately became the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI).

With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963,&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCII-1963&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bukstein_1964&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Binary Computer Codes and ASCII |author-first=Ed |author-last=Bukstein |journal=[[Electronics World]] |date=July 1964 |volume=72 |number=1 |pages=28â€“29 |url=http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/ElectronicsWorld/Jul1964/EW_Jul1964.htm |access-date=2016-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180933/http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/ElectronicsWorld/Jul1964/EW_Jul1964.htm |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|66, 245}} There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|435}} The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to ''sticks''{{Efn|name=&quot;NB_Stick&quot;|{{anchor|Stick}}The 128 characters of the 7-bit ASCII character set are divided into eight 16-character groups called ''sticks'' 0â€“7, associated with the three [[most-significant bit]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; Depending on the horizontal or vertical representation of the character map, ''sticks'' can correspond with either table rows or columns.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; 6 and 7,&lt;ref name=&quot;CCITT_1963&quot;&gt;Brief Report: Meeting of CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet, May 13â€“15, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Organization for Standardization]] TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_1963&quot;&gt;Report of ISO/TC/97/SC 2 â€“ Meeting of October 29â€“31, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Task Group X3.2.4, June 11, 1963, Pentagon Building, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Locating the lowercase letters in ''sticks''{{Efn|name=&quot;NB_Stick&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified [[case-insensitive]] character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

They proposed a [[9-track]] standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some [[punched card]] formats.
&lt;!-- To be mentioned: [[Decimal ASCII]] --&gt;

==Design considerations==

===Bit width===
The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems. Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[Digital data|digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|ComitÃ© Consultatif International TÃ©lÃ©phonique et TÃ©lÃ©graphique]] (CCITT) [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2) standard of 1924,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruxy_2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |date=2005-10-10 |title=BruXy: Radio Teletype communication |url=http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412130035/http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |archive-date=April 12, 2016 |access-date=2016-05-09 |quote=The transmitted code use International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA-2) which was introduced by CCITT in 1924.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bdcode&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Smith |author-first=Gil |title=Teletype Communication Codes |publisher=Baudot.net |date=2001 |url=http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf |access-date=2008-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820043949/http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FIELDATA]] (1956{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=My sources state 1957 rather than 1956, but Wikipedia states 1956 in various places. This needs to be sorted out with better sources.}}), and early [[EBCDIC]] (1963), more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.

ITA2 was in turn based on [[Baudot code]], the 5-bit telegraph code Ã‰mile Baudot invented in 1870 and patented in 1874.&lt;ref name=&quot;bdcode&quot; /&gt;

The committee debated the possibility of a [[Shift code|shift]] function (like in [[ITA2]]), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a [[six-bit character code|six-bit code]]. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]], as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|pages=215 Â§13.6, 236 Â§4}}

The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octet]]s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary-coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|pages=217 Â§c, 236 Â§5}} [[8-bit computing|Eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawyer_1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=Stanley A. |author-last1=Sawyer |author-first2=Steven George |author-last2=Krantz |title=A TeX Primer for Scientists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC&amp;pg=PA13 |date=1995 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-0-8493-7159-2 |page=13 |bibcode=1995tps..book.....S |access-date=October 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222151907/https://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC&amp;pg=PA13 |archive-date=December 22, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal organization===
The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two so-called ''ASCII sticks''{{Efn|name=&quot;NB_Stick&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|220, 236 8,9)}} The [[Space (punctuation)|&quot;space&quot; character]] had to come before graphics to make [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] easier, so it became position 20&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|237 Â§10}} for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits. The committee decided it was important to support uppercase [[sixbit code pages|64-character alphabets]], and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|228, 237 Â§14}} as was done in the [[DEC SIXBIT]] code (1963). [[Lower case|Lowercase]] letters were therefore not interleaved with [[uppercase]]. To keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter ''A'' was placed in position 41&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|238 Â§18}} The digits 0â€“9 are prefixed with 011, but the remaining [[Nibble|4 bits]] correspond to their respective values in binary, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward (for example, 5 in encoded to 011''0101'', where 5 is ''0101'' in binary).

Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on ''mechanical'' typewriters, not ''electric'' typewriters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savard&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Computer Keyboards |url=http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/kybint.htm |author-first=John J.

Thus, in ASCII &lt;code&gt;!&quot;#$%&lt;/code&gt; were placed in the second stick,{{Efn|name=&quot;NB_Stick&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; positions 1â€“5, corresponding to the digits 1â€“5 in the adjacent stick.{{Efn|name=&quot;NB_Stick&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; The parentheses could not correspond to ''9'' and ''0'', however, because the place corresponding to ''0'' was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; (underscore) from ''6'' and shifting the remaining characters, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with ''8'' and ''9''. This discrepancy from typewriters led to [[bit-paired keyboard]]s, notably the [[Teletype Model 33]], which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, differently from traditional mechanical typewriters.

Electric typewriters, notably the [[IBM Selectric]] (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become ''de facto'' standard on computers{{snd}} following the [[IBM PC]] (1981), especially [[Model M]] (1984){{snd}} and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The &lt;code&gt;/?&lt;/code&gt; pair also dates to the No. 2, and the &lt;code&gt;,&amp;lt; .&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; (comma) or &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the &lt;code&gt;;:&lt;/code&gt; pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly &lt;code&gt;-* =+&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;:* ;+ -=&lt;/code&gt;.

Some then-common typewriter characters were not included, notably &lt;code&gt;Â½ Â¼ Â¢&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;^ ` ~ &lt;/code&gt; were included as diacritics for international use, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt; &amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters &lt;code&gt;\ |&lt;/code&gt; (in addition to common &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;). The ''@'' symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented ''Ã€'' in the French variation, so the ''@'' was placed in position 40&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;, right before the letter A.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|243}}

The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [[end of message]] (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), &quot;who are you?&quot; (WRU), &quot;are you?&quot; (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the [[Hamming distance]] between their bit patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|243â€“245}}

===&lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot; id=&quot;Order&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Character order===
ASCII-code order is also called ''ASCIIbetical'' order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ASCIIbetical&amp;i=38025,00.asp |title=ASCIIbetical definition |magazine=[[PC Magazine]] |access-date=2008-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309183509/http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0%2C2542%2Ct%3DASCIIbetical%26i%3D38025%2C00.asp |archive-date=March 9, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collation]] of data is sometimes done in this order rather than &quot;standard&quot; alphabetical order ([[collating sequence]]). The main deviations in ASCII order are:
* All uppercase come before lowercase letters; for example, &quot;Z&quot; precedes &quot;a&quot;
* Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters

An intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values.

===&lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot; id=&quot;ASCII control characters&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Control characters===
[[File:US ASCII Control Character Symbols.png|thumb|right|Early symbols assigned to the 32 control characters, space and delete characters. ([[ISO 2047]], MIL-STD-188-100, 1972)]]
{{Main|Control character}}
ASCII reserves the first 32 [[code point]]s (numbers 0â€“31 decimal) and the last one (number 127 decimal) for [[control character]]s. These are codes intended  to control [[peripheral device]]s (such as [[computer printer|printers]]), or to provide [[Metadata|meta-information]] about data streams, such as those stored on magnetic tape. Despite their name, these code points do not represent printable characters (i.e. they are not characters at all, but signals). For debugging purposes, &quot;placeholder&quot; symbols (such as those given in [[ISO 2047]] and its predecessors) are assigned to them.

For example, character 0x0A represents the &quot;line feed&quot; function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents &quot;[[backspace]]&quot;. {{IETF RFC|2822}} refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or [[Whitespace (computer science)|white space]] as non-whitespace control characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC-2822&quot;&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Internet Message Format |editor-first1=Peter W. |editor-last1=Resnick |date=April 2001 |rfc=2822 |access-date=2016-06-13}} (NB. NO-WS-CTL.)&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.

The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]], and sometimes accidental, for example the standard is unclear about the meaning of &quot;delete&quot;.

Probably the most influential single device affecting the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([[Delete key|delete]]) became ''de facto'' standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-G (code 7, BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character.  Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (control-O, shift in) interpreted as &quot;delete previous character&quot; was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.

When a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving control-Q (XON, transmit on) caused the tape reader to resume.  This so-called [[Flow control (data)|flow control]] technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a &quot;handshaking&quot; signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending [[buffer overflow]]; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems, control-S retains its meaning, but control-Q is replaced by a second control-S to resume output.

The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ control-R (DC2) and control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and &lt;s&gt;TAPE&lt;/s&gt; respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;McConnell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding ASCII Codes |author-last1=McConnell |author-first1=Robert |author-last2=Haynes |author-first2=James |author-last3=Warren |author-first3=Richard |url=http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |access-date=2014-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227190425/http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Delete vs backspace====
The Teletype could not move its typehead backwards, so it did not have a key on its keyboard to send a BS (backspace). Instead, there was a key marked {{keypress|RUB OUT}} that sent code 127 (DEL). The purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a manually-input paper tape: the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up, then type the rubout, which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |title=Re: editor and word processor history (was: Re: RTF for emacs) |author=Barry Margolin |mailing-list=help-gnu-emacs |date=May 29, 2014 |access-date=July 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133149/http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teletypes were commonly used with the less-expensive computers from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC); these systems had to use what keys were available, and thus the DEL character was assigned to erase the previous character.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdp-6-monitor-manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |title=PDP-6 Multiprogramming System Manual |page=43 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1965 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140253/http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pdp-10-monitor-manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |title=PDP-10 Reference Handbook, Book 3, Communicating with the Monitor |at=p. 5-5 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1969 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115083418/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, DEC video terminals (by default) sent the DEL character for the key marked &quot;Backspace&quot; while the separate key marked &quot;Delete&quot; sent an [[escape sequence]]; many other competing terminals sent a BS character for the backspace key.

The early Unix tty drivers, unlike some modern implementations, allowed only one character to be set to erase the previous character in canonical input processing (where a very simple line editor is available); this could be set to BS ''or'' DEL, but not both, resulting in recurring situations of ambiguity where users had to decide depending on what terminal they were using ([[Shell (computing)|shells]] that allow line editing, such as [[KornShell|ksh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], and [[Z shell|zsh]], understand both). The assumption that no key sent a BS character allowed Ctrl+H to be used for other purposes, such as the &quot;help&quot; prefix command in [[GNU Emacs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html|title=Help - GNU Emacs Manual|access-date=July 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711223750/https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html|archive-date=July 11, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Escape====
Many more of the control characters have been assigned meanings quite different from their original ones. The &quot;escape&quot; character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending of other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning, an &quot;escape sequence&quot;. This is the same meaning of &quot;escape&quot; encountered in URL encodings, [[C (programming language)|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this interpretation has been co-opted and has eventually been changed.

In modern usage, an ESC sent ''to'' the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, which can be used to address the cursor, scroll a region, set/query various terminal properties, and more. They are usually in the form of a so-called &quot;[[ANSI escape code]]&quot; (often starting with a &quot;[[Control Sequence Introducer]]&quot;, &quot;CSI&quot;, &quot;{{Mono|ESC [}}&quot;) from ECMA-48 (1972) and its successors.  Some escape sequences do not have introducers, like the [[VT100]] full reset command &quot;{{Mono|ESC c}}&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html|title=XTerm Control Sequences|access-date=January 17, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, an ESC read ''from'' the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band data|out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation or special mode, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[Vi (text editor)|vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (system call)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.

====End of line====
The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring &quot;plain text&quot; files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both &quot;carriage return&quot; (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and &quot;line feed&quot; (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name &quot;carriage return&quot; comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moves while the typebars that strike the ribbon remain stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the paper for the next line.

DEC operating systems ([[OS/8]], [[RT-11]], [[RSX-11]], [[RSTS/E|RSTS]], [[TOPS-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally Teletype machines) would work. By the time so-called &quot;glass TTYs&quot; (later called CRTs or &quot;dumb terminals&quot;) came along, the convention was so well established that [[backward compatibility]] necessitated continuing to follow it. When [[Gary Kildall]] created [[CP/M]], he was inspired by some of the command line interface conventions used in DEC's RT-11 operating system.

Until the introduction of PC DOS in 1981, [[IBM]] had no influence in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC encoding instead of ASCII, and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of &quot;carriage return&quot; was meaningless. IBM's PC DOS (also marketed as [[MS-DOS]] by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on CP/M,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|title=Is DOS a Rip-Off of CP/M?|author=Tim Paterson|date=August 8, 2007|website=DosMan Drivel|author-link=Tim Paterson|access-date=April 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420075137/http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|archive-date=April 20, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows]] in turn inherited it from MS-DOS.

Requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity as to how to interpret each character when encountered by itself. To simplify matters, [[plain text]] data streams, including files, on [[Multics]] used line feed (LF) alone as a line terminator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.multicians.org/jhs-jfo-terminals.pdf |title=Technical and human engineering problems in connecting terminals to a time-sharing system |author-last1=Ossanna |author-first1=J.

[[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Amiga]] systems, adopted this convention from Multics.  On the other hand, the original [[Macintosh OS]], [[Apple DOS]], and [[ProDOS]] used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple later replaced these obsolete operating systems with their Unix-based [[macOS]] (formerly named OS X) operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well. The Radio Shack [[TRS-80]] also used a lone CR to terminate lines.

Computers attached to the [[ARPANET]] included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and [[TENEX (operating system)|TENEX]] using CR-LF line endings; machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings; and machines running operating systems such as [[OS/360]] that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and which used EBCDIC rather than ASCII encoding.  The [[Telnet]] protocol defined an ASCII &quot;[[Network Virtual Terminal]]&quot; (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network. Telnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC-158&quot;&gt;{{cite IETF |title=TELNET Protocol |rfc=158 |pages=4â€“5 |author-first=T. |author-last=O'Sullivan |date=1971-05-19 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) |access-date=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[File Transfer Protocol]] adopted the Telnet protocol, including use of the Network Virtual Terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC-542&quot;&gt;{{cite IETF |title=File Transfer Protocol |rfc=542 |author-first=Nancy J. |author-last=Neigus |date=1973-08-12 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) |access-date=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC-765&quot;&gt;{{cite IETF |title=File Transfer Protocol |rfc=765 |author-first=Jon |author-last=Postel |author-link=Jon Postel |date=June 1980 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) |access-date=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols, and to other network protocols, such as those used for E-mail and the World Wide Web, on systems not using the NVT's CR-LF line-ending convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EOLTranslationPlan |title=EOL translation plan for Mercurial |publisher=Mercurial |access-date=2017-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616235536/https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EOLTranslationPlan |archive-date=June 16, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bare LFs in SMTP |url=http://cr.yp.to/docs/smtplf.html |author-first=Daniel J. |author-last=Bernstein |author-link=Daniel J.

====End of file/stream====
The PDP-6 monitor,&lt;ref name=&quot;pdp-6-monitor-manual&quot;/&gt; and its PDP-10 successor TOPS-10,&lt;ref name=&quot;pdp-10-monitor-manual&quot;/&gt; used control-Z (SUB) as an end-of-file indication for input from a terminal.  Some operating systems such as CP/M tracked file length only in units of disk blocks, and used control-Z to mark the end of the actual text in the file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/digitalResearch/cpm/1.4/CPM_1.4_Interface_Guide_1978.pdf |title=CP/M 1.4 Interface Guide |date=1978 |page=10 |publisher=[[Digital Research]] |access-date=October 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529055800/http://bitsavers.org/pdf/digitalResearch/cpm/1.4/CPM_1.4_Interface_Guide_1978.pdf |archive-date=May 29, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, EOF, or [[end-of-file]], was used colloquially and conventionally as a [[three-letter acronym]] for control-Z instead of SUBstitute.  The end-of-text character ([[End-of-text character|ETX]]), also known as [[control-C]], was inappropriate for a variety of reasons, while using control-Z as the control character to end a file is analogous to the letter Z's position at the end of the alphabet, and serves as a very convenient [[Mnemonic device|mnemonic aid]]. A historically common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX character convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.

The Unix terminal driver uses the end-of-transmission character ([[End-of-Transmission character|EOT]]), also known as control-D, to indicate the end of a data stream.

In the [[C programming language]], and in Unix conventions, the [[null character]] is used to terminate text [[string (computer science)|strings]]; such [[null-terminated string]]s can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for &quot;zero&quot;.

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the &quot;rubout&quot; code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo &quot;{{tt|^H}}&quot; for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any {{key press|Delete}} key produce something other than the Delete character.}}

Codes 20&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; to 7E&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, [[punctuation mark]]s, and a few miscellaneous symbols. There are 95 printable characters in total.{{efn|Printed out, the characters are: {{Pre|&lt;nowiki&gt; !&quot;#$%&amp;'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;ZeroWidthSpace;&lt;nowiki&gt;@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;ZeroWidthSpace;&lt;nowiki&gt;`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}}}

Code 20&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;, the &quot;space&quot; character, denotes the space between words, as produced by the space bar of a keyboard. Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic (rather than a control character)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|223}}&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC-20_1968&quot; /&gt; it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section.

Code 7F&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the non-printable &quot;delete&quot; (DEL) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart; it is covered in the previous section's chart.  Earlier versions of ASCII used the up arrow instead of the [[caret (computing)|caret]] (5E&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;) and the left arrow instead of the underscore (5F&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCII-1963&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes_2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=First-Hand: Chad is Our Most Important Product: An Engineer's Memory of Teletype Corporation |author-first=Jim |publisher=Engineering and Technology History Wiki (ETHW) |date=2015-01-13 |author-last=Haynes |url=https://ethw.org/First-Hand:Chad_is_Our_Most_Important_Product:_An_Engineer's_Memory_of_Teletype_Corporation |access-date=2023-02-14 |quote=There was the change from 1961 ASCII to 1968 ASCII. Some computer languages used characters in 1961 ASCII such as up arrow and left arrow. These characters disappeared from 1968 ASCII. We worked with Fred Mocking, who by now was in Sales at [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]], on a type cylinder that would compromise the changing characters so that the meanings of 1961 ASCII were not totally lost. The underscore character was made rather wedge-shaped so it could also serve as a left arrow.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
ASCII was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]'s TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit [[ITA2]], which was also used by the competing [[Telex]] teleprinter system. [[Robert William Bemer|Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the [[Escape character|escape sequence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel_1999&quot;/&gt; His British colleague [[Hugh McGregor Ross]] helped to popularize this work{{snd}} according to Bemer, &quot;so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the ''Bemerâ€“Ross Code'' in Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Robert William Bemer |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |url=http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/EUROPE.HTM |title=Bemer meets Europe (Computer Standards) â€“ Computer History Vignettes |publisher=Trailing-edge.com |access-date=2008-04-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017062722/http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/EUROPE.HTM |archive-date=2013-10-17}} (NB. Bemer was employed at [[IBM]] at that time.)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called &quot;the father of ASCII&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/bemer_bob.htm |title=Robert William Bemer: Biography |date=2013-03-09 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616081929/http://www.thocp.net/biographies/bemer_bob.htm |archive-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 1968, US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] mandated that all computers purchased by the [[United States Federal Government]] support ASCII, stating:&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_1968&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum Approving the Adoption by the Federal Government of a Standard Code for Information Interchange |author-last=Johnson |author-first=Lyndon Baines |author-link=Lyndon Baines Johnson |publisher=The American Presidency Project |date=1968-03-11 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28724 |access-date=2008-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914121230/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28724 |archive-date=September 14, 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.folklore.computers/gbg5YVFaT48/wlVFfJ2j4hYJ|title=Re: Early history of ASCII?|author=Richard S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have also approved recommendations of the [[Secretary of Commerce]] &amp;#91;[[Luther H. Hodges]]&amp;#93; regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.
All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ASCII was the most common character encoding on the [[World Wide Web]] until December 2007, when [[UTF-8]] encoding surpassed it; UTF-8 is [[backward compatible]] with ASCII.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dubost_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=UTF-8 Growth on the Web |author-last=Dubost |author-first=Karl |date=2008-05-06 |work=W3C Blog |publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] |url=http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/05/utf8-web-growth.html |access-date=2010-08-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616084132/https://www.w3.org/blog/2008/05/utf8-web-growth/ |archive-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UTF-8_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Moving to Unicode 5.1 |author-last=Davis |author-first=Mark |author-link=Mark Davis (Unicode) |date=2008-05-05 |work=Official Google Blog |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/moving-to-unicode-51.html |access-date=2010-08-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616084637/https://googleblog.blogspot.de/2008/05/moving-to-unicode-51.html |archive-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Unicode nearing 50% of the web |author-last=Davis |author-first=Mark |author-link=Mark Davis (Unicode) |date=2010-01-28 |work=Official Google Blog |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/unicode-nearing-50-of-web.html |access-date=2010-08-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616085323/https://googleblog.blogspot.de/2010/01/unicode-nearing-50-of-web.html |archive-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot; id=&quot;Variants&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Variants and derivations==
As computer technology spread throughout the world, different [[Standardization|standards bodies]] and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as &quot;[[ASCII extension]]s&quot;, although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range. Furthermore, the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII.

===&lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot; id=&quot;7-bit&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;7-bit codes===
{{Main|ISO/IEC 646|ITU T.50}}{{See also|UTF-7}}
From early in its development,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Specific Criteria&quot;, attachment to memo from R. W. Reach, &quot;X3-2 Meeting â€“ September 14 and 15&quot;, September 18, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard.

&lt;!-- ITU-T ITU T.50
International Reference Alphabet (IRA)
International Alphabet No. 5 (IA5) --&gt;
Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [[ISO 646]] (1967) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English [[alphabet]] and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's [[pound sterling]] (Â£); e.g. with [[code page 1104]]. Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the US and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters.

Many other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. [[Ã©]], [[Ã±]], [[ÃŸ]], [[Å]]), currency symbols (e.g. [[Â£]], [[Â¥]]), etc. See also [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia).

It would share most characters in common, but assign other locally useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for &quot;national use&quot;. However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967&lt;ref name=&quot;MarÃ©chal_1967&quot;&gt;{{citation |author-last=MarÃ©chal |author-first=R. |title=ISO/TC 97 â€“ Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052 |date=1967-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be ''de facto'' standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.

ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit character set. It does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and, therefore, which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.

Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to &quot;national use&quot; code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as

:&lt;code&gt;Ã¤ aÃ„iÃœ = 'Ã–n'; Ã¼&lt;/code&gt;

instead of

:&lt;code&gt;{ a[i] = '\n'; }&lt;/code&gt;

[[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or [[Usenet]]) contained &quot;{, }&quot; and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get &quot;N{ jag har sm|rg}sar&quot; as the answer, which should be &quot;NÃ¤ jag har smÃ¶rgÃ¥sar&quot; meaning &quot;No I've got sandwiches&quot;.

In Japan and Korea, still {{As of|2021|alt=as of the 2020s|post=,|df=US}} a variation of ASCII is used, in which the [[backslash]] (5C hex) is rendered as Â¥ (a [[Yen sign]], in Japan) or â‚© (a [[Won sign]], in Korea). This means that, for example, the file path C:\Users\Smith is shown as C:Â¥UsersÂ¥Smith (in Japan) or C:â‚©Usersâ‚©Smith (in Korea).

In Europe, [[teletext character set]]s, which are variants of ASCII, are used for broadcast TV subtitles, defined by [[World System Teletext]] and broadcast using the DVB-TXT standard for embedding teletext into DVB transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dvb.org/?standard=specification-for-conveying-itu-r-system-b-teletext-in-dvb-bitstreams |title=DVB-TXT (Teletext) Specification for conveying ITU-R System B Teletext in DVB bitstreams}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case that the subtitles were initially authored for teletext and converted, the derived subtitle formats are constrained to the same character sets.

===&lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot; id=&quot;8-bit&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;8-bit codes===
{{Main|Extended ASCII}}{{See also|ISO/IEC 8859|UTF-8}}
&lt;!-- to be mentioned [[USASCII-8]] --&gt;
Eventually, as 8-, [[16-bit computing|16-]], and [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] (and later [[64-bit computing|64-bit]]) computers began to replace [[12-bit computing|12-]], [[18-bit computing|18-]], and [[36-bit computing|36-bit]] computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.

For some countries, 8-bit extensions of ASCII were developed that included support for characters used in local languages; for example, [[ISCII]] for India and [[VISCII]] for Vietnam. [[Kaypro]] [[CP/M]] computers used the &quot;upper&quot; 128 characters for the Greek alphabet.{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}

Even for markets where it was not necessary to add many characters to support additional languages, manufacturers of early home computer systems often developed their own 8-bit extensions of ASCII to include additional characters, such as [[box-drawing characters]], [[semigraphics]], and [[Sprite (computer graphics)|video game sprites]]. Often, these additions also replaced control characters (index 0 to 31, as well as index 127) with even more platform-specific extensions. In other cases, the extra bit was used for some other purpose, such as toggling [[inverse video]]; this approach was used by [[ATASCII]], an extension of ASCII developed by [[Atari]].

Most ASCII extensions are based on ASCII-1967 (the current standard), but some extensions are instead based on the earlier ASCII-1963. For example, [[PETSCII]], which was developed by [[Commodore International]] for their [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] systems, is based on ASCII-1963. Likewise, many [[Sharp MZ character set]]s are based on ASCII-1963.

IBM defined [[code page 437]] for the [[IBM PC]], replacing the control characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapping additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/pc/pc/6025008_PC_Technical_Reference_Aug81.pdf |title=Technical Reference |at=Appendix C. Of Characters Keystrokes and Color |edition=First |date=August 1981 |series=Personal Computer Hardware Reference Library |publisher=IBM}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]] as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] defined [[Mac OS Roman]] for the Macintosh and [[Adobe Inc.|Adobe]] defined the [[PostScript Standard Encoding]] for [[PostScript]]; both sets contained &quot;international&quot; letters, typographic symbols and punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.

The [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) provided a standard that most systems copied (or at least were based on, when not copied exactly). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as [[ISO-8859-1]]), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing. ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings on the [[World Wide Web]] until 2008, when [[UTF-8]] overtook them.&lt;ref name=&quot;UTF-8_2008&quot;/&gt;

[[ISO/IEC 4873]] introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80â€“9F [[hexadecimal]] range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unicode-5.0_2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=The Unicode Consortium |editor-first=Julie D. |editor-last=Allen |title=The Unicode standard, Version 5.0 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley Professional]] |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, US |isbn=978-0-321-48091-0 |chapter-url=http://unicode.org/book/ch13.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://unicode.org/book/ch13.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |access-date=2015-03-13 |chapter=Chapter 13: Special Areas and Format Characters |page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unicode===
{{Main|Unicode|ISO/IEC 10646}}{{See also|Basic Latin (Unicode block)}}
[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16-, or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]], and [[UTF-32]], respectively).

ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters.  Even more importantly, [[forward compatibility]] is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=utf-8(7)&amp;nbsp;â€“ Linux manual page |publisher=Man7.org |date=2014-02-26 |url=http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |access-date=2014-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232059/http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |archive-date=April 22, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animation''' is a filmmaking technique by which [[image|still images]] are manipulated to create [[Motion picture|moving images]]. In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets ([[cel]]s) to be photographed and exhibited on film. Animation has been recognized as an artistic medium, specifically within the [[Entertainment#Industry|entertainment industry]]. Many animations are [[Computer animation|computer animations]] made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Stop motion animation]], in particular [[claymation]], has continued to exist alongside these other forms. 

Animation is contrasted with [[live-action film]], although the two do not exist in isolation. Many moviemakers have produced [[Films with live action and animation|films that are a hybrid of the two]]. As CGI increasingly [[Photorealism|approximates photographic imagery]], filmmakers can easily [[Compositing|composite]] 3D animations into their film rather than using [[Practical effect|practical effects]] for showy [[visual effects]] (VFX).

{{TOC limit|3}}

== General overview ==

[[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[Computer animation#Animation methods|3D animation]], while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two- and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s, or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].

A '''cartoon''' is an animated film, usually a [[short film]], featuring an [[cartoon|exaggerated visual style]]. The style takes inspiration from [[comic strips]], often featuring [[anthropomorphic animal]]s, [[superhero]]es, or the adventures of human protagonists. Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds), the action often centers on [[cartoon violence|violent]] [[physical comedy|pratfalls]] such as falls, collisions, and explosions that would be lethal in real life.

The illusion of animationâ€”as in motion pictures in generalâ€”has traditionally been attributed to the [[persistence of vision]] and later to the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain. The illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other, with unnoticeable interruptions, is a [[stroboscopic effect]]. While [[animator]]s traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background, computer animation is usually based on programming paths between [[key frame]]s to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment.

[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|phÃ©nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]], and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on computers, technology such as the [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.

In addition to short films, [[feature films]], [[Television show|television series]], animated GIFs, and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s, and [[visual effects]].{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}

The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanicsâ€”for instance, moving images in [[magic lantern]] showsâ€”can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].

==Etymology==
The word &quot;animation&quot; stems from the Latin &quot;animÄtiÅn&quot;, stem of &quot;animÄtiÅ&quot;, meaning &quot;a bestowing of life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier meaning of the English word is &quot;liveliness&quot; and has been in use much longer than the meaning of &quot;moving image medium&quot;.

==History&lt;!--'Animated cartoon' redirects here--&gt;==
{{main|History of animation}}

===Before cinematography===
{{main|Early history of animation}}
Long before modern animation began, audiences around the world were captivated by the magic of moving characters. For centuries, master artists and craftsmen have brought puppets, [[Automaton|automatons]], [[shadow puppets]], and fantastical [[Lantern|lanterns]] to life, inspiring the imagination through physically manipulated wonders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=How Modern Animation Originated from Live and Stage Performances - studio9 |url=https://studio9.ie/journal/how-modern-animation-originated-from-live-and-stage-performances |access-date=2024-02-18 |website=studio9.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], from 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]
In 1833, the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] disc (better known as the [[phenakistiscope|phÃ©nakisticope]]) introduced the principle of modern animation, which would also be applied in the [[zoetrope]] (introduced in 1866), the [[flip book]] (1868), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877) and [[film]].

===Silent era===
[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[Ã‰mile Cohl]]]]
When [[cinematography]] eventually broke through in the 1890s, the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment. It took years before animation found its way to the cinemas. The successful short ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) by [[J. Stuart Blackton]] popularized [[stop-motion]] and reportedly inspired [[Ã‰mile Cohl]] to create ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908), regarded as the oldest known example of a complete [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]] on standard cinematographic film. Other great artistic and very influential short films were created by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed hand-drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |date=2023-07-22 |title=Winsor McCay: American Animator|encyclopedia = Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Winsor-McCay |access-date= |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s, the production of animated &quot;[[cartoons]]&quot; became an industry in the US.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} Successful producer [[John Randolph Bray]] and animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}} [[Felix the Cat]], who debuted in 1919, became the first fully realized animal character in the history of American animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Michael|last1=Cart|title=The Cat With the Killer Personality|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/31/books/the-cat-with-the-killer-personality.html|language=en-US|url-status=live|date=31 March 1991|access-date=December 30, 2022|archivedate=April 11, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411005148/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/31/books/the-cat-with-the-killer-personality.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Golden Age of American animation}}
In 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. Although [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation's]] actual output relative to total global animation output has always been very small, the studio has overwhelmingly dominated the &quot;aesthetic norms&quot; of animation ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Furniss_Page_107&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Furniss |first1=Maureen |title=Art in Motion, Revised Edition |chapter=Classical-era Disney Studio |author1-link=Maureen Furniss |date=2007 |pages=107â€“132 |publisher=John Libbey Publishing |location=New Barnet |isbn=9780861966639 |doi=10.2307/j.ctt2005zgm.9 |jstor=j.ctt2005zgm.9 |edition=2014 print-on-demand ed., based on 2007 revised |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005zgm.9|oclc=1224213919}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until the 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Barrier |first=Michael |title=Hollywood Cartoons American Animation in Its Golden Age |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=9780199839223 |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long-lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Out of the Inkwell]]' [[Koko the Clown]] (1918), [[Bimbo (Fleischer Studios)|Bimbo]] and [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (1933) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper the Friendly Ghost]] (1945), [[Warner Bros.

In 1917, Italian-Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El ApÃ³stol]]'' (now [[lost film|lost]]), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere, the film was confiscated by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=animafest.hr |url=https://www.animafest.hr/en/2009/film/read_all/quirino_cristiani_the_mystery_of_the_first_animated_movies |access-date=2024-02-18 |website=www.animafest.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length [[silhouette animation]] ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lewis |first=Maria |date=December 15, 2020 |title=The Lasting Legacy of Lotte Reiniger |url=https://www.acmi.net.au/stories-and-ideas/lasting-legacy-lotte-reiniger/ |access-date=August 8, 2023 |website=[[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Studios]] premiered their first animated feature (using the Rotoscope technique invented by Max Fleischer in 1915) ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features {{as of|lc=y| May 2020}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;snowwhite1&quot;&gt;Total prior to 50th anniversary reissue: {{cite news |last=Culhane |first=John |title='Snow White' At 50: Undimmed Magic |date=July 12, 1987 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |access-date=|quote=By now, it has grossed about $330&amp;nbsp;million worldwide â€“ so it remains one of the most popular films ever made. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604200704/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |archive-date=June 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;snowwhite2&quot;&gt;1987 and 1993 grosses from North America: {{cite web |title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs â€“ Releases |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&amp;id=snowwhite.htm |access-date= |quote=1987 release â€“ $46,594,212; 1993 release â€“ $41,634,471 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529094807/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&amp;id=snowwhite.htm |archive-date=May 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940), Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941â€“1942) and Disney's feature films ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951) and ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955) failed at the box office. For decades afterward, Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

Although relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Soviet [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and reached 1,582 titles in 2018. China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France, and Belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable and influential [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].{{fact|date=December 2022}}

===Television===
Animation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most developed countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960â€“1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series), ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981â€“1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series, the first cartoon of [[The Simpsons shorts|The Simpsons]] (1987), which later developed into [[The Simpsons|its own show]] (in 1989) and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' (since 1999) as part of a &quot;renaissance&quot; of American animation.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

While US animated series also spawned successes internationally, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, relatively often preferring [[stop motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] TV series became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, resulting in hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973â€“1977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken MÃ¤nner/å°ã•ãªãƒã‚¤ã‚­ãƒ³ã‚° ãƒ“ãƒƒã‚± (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974), ''[[Maya the Honey Bee|Maya the Bee]]'' (Japan/Germany 1975) and ''[[The Jungle Book (1989 TV series)|The Jungle Book]]'' (Italy/Japan 1989).{{fact|date=December 2022}}

===Switch from cels to computers===
{{main|History of computer animation}}
[[Computer animation]] was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2022-10-07 |title=What was the first movie to feature a CGI lead character? |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/first-movie-cgi-lead-character/ |access-date=2023-05-24 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera.&lt;ref name=&quot;first digital guinness&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=First fully digital feature film |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film/ |work=Guinness World Records |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |access-date=27 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced using the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS), developed by [[Pixar]]  in collaboration with [[The Walt Disney Company]] in the late 1980s, in a style similar to traditional cel animation .&lt;ref name=&quot;Ness 2015 p197&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Ness | first=Mari | title=The Arrival of Computer Animation: The Rescuers Down Under | website=Reactor Magazine | date=December 17, 2015 | url=https://reactormag.com/the-arrival-of-computer-animation-the-rescuers-down-under/ | access-date=February 27, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guinness World Records 2024 a420&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=First fully digital feature film | website=Guinness World Records | date=February 27, 2024 | url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film | access-date=February 27, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allison 2022 u732&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Allison | first=Austin | title=Disney and Pixar's Top 5 Most Innovative Animation Technologies, Explained | website=Collider | date=January 23, 2022 | url=https://collider.com/disney-pixar-animation-technologies-explained/#caps | access-date=February 27, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, became the dominant technique following the success of Pixar's ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first computer-animated feature in this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Zorthian |first=Julia |date=2015-11-19 |title=How ''Toy Story'' Changed Movie History |url=https://time.com/4118006/20-years-toy-story-pixar/ |access-date=2024-01-29 |magazine=TIME |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer-animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance, in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Amidi |first=Amid |title= Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' [Exclusive] |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |date=1 June 2015 |access-date=12 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw |last1=Netflix: Behind the Streams | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211122/FHxhr6KAaUw| archive-date=2021-11-22 | url-status=live|title=The Origins of Klaus |date= 10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bernstein |first=Abbie |title=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs &amp; Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN |url= http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/ |work=Assignment X |publisher= Midnight Productions, Inc|access-date=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title='Paperman' short to play before 'Wreck it Ralph'|first1= Anthony |last1 = Breznican  |url= https://ew.com/article/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/|magazine=Entertainment Weekly |date = 28 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231224033559/https://ew.com/article/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/ |archive-date= Dec 24, 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarto|first= Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short 'Paperman' |date=June 1, 2012 |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|access-date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/ |title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|access-date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic status==
In 2010, the animation market was estimated to be worth circa US$80 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} By 2020, the value had increased to an estimated US$270 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Global animation market value 2017â€“2020 |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/817601/worldwide-animation-market-size/ |access-date=2022-03-31 |website=Statista |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and 2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Mayorga |first=Emilio |date=2023-05-19 |title=How Spain's animation sector became a force to be reckoned with |url=https://www.screendaily.com/features/how-spains-animation-sector-became-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/5182259.article |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=Screen |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240124214632/https://www.screendaily.com/features/how-spains-animation-sector-became-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/5182259.article |archive-date=Jan 24, 2024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-05-17 |title=The millennial daring to change animation industry |url=https://nation.africa/kenya/life-and-style/mynetwork/the-millennial-daring-to-change-animation-industry--4238068 |first1=Margaret |last1=Maina |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=Nation |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Artists wanted â€” in VFX, animation, gaming and more |url=https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/local-arts/artists-wanted-in-vfx-animation-gaming-and-more |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=Vancouver Sun |date=Aug 21, 2022 |first1=Shawn |last1=Conner |language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education, propaganda and commercials==
The clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. It has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lee |first=Tina |date=2019-05-02 |title=What Are Disney's 12 Principles of Animation? (With Examples) |url=https://academyofanimatedart.com/the-12-principles-of-animation-according-to-disney/ |access-date=2024-04-15 |website=Academy of Animated Art |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

Animation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Our History |publisher=Rice KrispiesÂ®|url=https://www.ricekrispies.com/en_US/our-story.html|access-date=2020-06-16 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] &quot;[[Kills Bugs Dead]]&quot; commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Taylor|first=Heather|date=2019-06-10|title=The Raid Bugs: Characters We Love To Hate|url=https://popicon.life/the-raid-bugs-characters-we-love-to-hate/|access-date=2020-06-16|website=PopIcon.life|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media, merchandise and theme parks==
Apart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.

Animation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen (which is often the case in Japan, where many [[manga]] are adapted into [[anime]]), original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive form of animation that became its own medium) have been derived from films and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Cine-Files Â» New Screen Order: How Video Games are Changing Cinema Interiority |url=https://www.thecine-files.com/new-screen-order/ |access-date=2023-05-11 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

While very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey Mouse#Pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated [[Disneyana Fan Club]] (since 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=History |url=https://disneyanafanclub.weebly.com/history.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230426153040/https://disneyanafanclub.weebly.com/history.html |archive-date=April 26, 2023 |access-date=2023-07-10 |website=Disneyana Fan Club {{!}} Preserving the Legacy of Walt Disney |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products#Disney resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The Walt Disney Company#Financial data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies.

==Awards==
{{Main|List of animation awards}}
As with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. Many are part of general or regional film award programs, like the China's [[Golden Rooster Awards|Golden Rooster Award]] for [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation|Best Animation]] (since 1981). Awards programs dedicated to animation, with many categories, include [[ASIFA-Hollywood]]'s [[Annie Awards]], the [[Emile Awards]] in Europe and the [[Anima Mundi (event)|Anima Mundi]] awards in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=51st Annual Annie Awards |url=https://annieawards.org/ |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=annieawards.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Introduction |url=https://animationawards.eu/presentation/ |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=European Animation Awards {{!}} Emile Awards |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2014-11-18 |title=Anima Mundi |url=http://www.animamundi.com.br/ |access-date=2024-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118120723/http://www.animamundi.com.br/ |archive-date=18 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academy Awards===
{{Main|List of animated feature films nominated for Academy Awards}}
Apart from [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]] (since 1932) and [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] (since 2002), animated movies have been nominated and rewarded in other categories, relatively often for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].

''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was the first animated film nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], in 1991. ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009) and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010) also received Best Picture nominations, after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Academy Expands Best-Picture Pool to 10 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/movies/25oscars.html | last=Cieply |first=Michael |date=June 24, 2009 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Joy &amp;amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|''Joy &amp; Heron'']]
The creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}

The most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{fact|date=December 2022}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100â€“01}}

Another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}

This problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52â€“57}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}

Unlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99â€“100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

{{Main|Traditional animation}}
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]
'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277â€“79}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195â€“201}}

The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35 mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35â€“36, 52â€“53}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The &quot;look&quot; of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[Character animation|character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 90 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52â€“57}} Some animation producers have used the term &quot;tradigital&quot; (a play on the words &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;digital&quot;) to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.

Examples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63â€“65}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).

====Full====
'''Full animation''' is the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194â€“95}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are often animated on &quot;twos&quot;, sometimes on &quot;ones&quot;, which means that 12 to 24 drawings are required for a single second of film. {{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25â€“26}}

====Limited====
{{Main|Limited animation}}
'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or &quot;skippy&quot; movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54â€“55}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later the [[Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).

====Rotoscoping====
{{Main|Rotoscoping}}
'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163â€“64}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (Japan, 2013).{{fact|date=December 2022}}

====Live-action blending====
{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}
'''[[List of films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live-action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162â€“63}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live-action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18â€“19}} Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' (1923â€“1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Volere volare]]'' (Italy 1991), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).{{fact|date=December 2022}}

===Stop motion===
{{Main|Stop motion}}
[[Stop motion]] is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the materials used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop-motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}
; [[Stop motion]] : Typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155â€“56}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[JiÅ™Ã­ Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005â€“present).
:; [[Puppetoons]] : Created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92â€“93}}
[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]
; [[Clay animation]] or [[Plasticine]] animation : (Often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name). It uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150â€“151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151â€“54}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''The [[Gumby]] Show'' (US, 1957â€“1967), ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (Italy, 1974â€“2005), ''[[Morph (animation)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977â€“2000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan Å vankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984). Films include ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', ''[[Chicken Run]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]''.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=250}}
:; [[Strata-cut animation]] : Most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long bread-like &quot;loaf&quot; of clay, internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery, is sliced into thin sheets, with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut, eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within.{{sfn|Furniss|1998|pp=52â€“54}}
; [[Cutout animation]] : A type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=59â€“60}} Examples include [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animated sequences from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (UK, 1969â€“1974); ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973); ''[[Tale of Tales (1979 film)|Tale of Tales]]'' (Russia, 1979), [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]] the first cutout animation [[South Park (franchise)|South Park]] (1992), the pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series (and sometimes in episodes) of ''[[South Park]]'' (US, 1997) and the music video Live for the moment, from Verona Riots band (produced by Alberto Serrano and NÃ­vola UyÃ¡, Spain 2014).
:; [[Silhouette animation]] : A variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=170â€“171}} Examples include ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'' ([[Weimar Republic]], 1926) and ''[[Princes et Princesses]]'' (France, 2000).
; [[Model animation]] : Stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world.{{sfn|Harryhausen|Dalton|2008|pages=9â€“11}} Intercutting, [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]] effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harryhausen_Dalton222â€“226&quot;/&gt; Examples include the work of [[Ray Harryhausen]], as seen in films, ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963),&lt;ref name=&quot;Harryhausen_Dalton18&quot;/&gt; and the work of [[Willis H. O'Brien]] on films, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933).
:;[[Go motion]] : A variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop motion.{{sfn|Smith|1986|p=90}} The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effect]] scenes for the film ''[[Star Wars: Episode V â€“ The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Watercutter|2012}} Another example is the dragon named &quot;Vermithrax&quot; from the 1981 film ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]''.{{sfn|Smith|1986|pages=91â€“95}}
; [[Object animation]] : The use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=51â€“57}}
:; [[Graphic animation]] : Uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame by frame to create movement.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=128}} At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.
:; [[Brickfilm]] : A subgenre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation.{{sfn|Paul|2005|pages=357â€“63}}{{sfn|Herman|2014}} These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, [[YouTube]] and the availability of cheap cameras and [[animation software]].{{CN|date=November 2022}}
; [[Pixilation]] : Involves the use of live humans as stop-motion characters.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75â€“79}} This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75â€“79}} Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts, and the [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' by [[Norman McLaren]].

===Computer===
{{Main|Computer animation}}
'''Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}}{{sfn|Serenko|2007}} 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=405}} 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.{{sfn|Serenko|2007|p=482}}

====2D====
{{main|2D computer graphics}}
[[File:Catenary animation.gif|thumb|A 2D animation of two circles joined by a chain]]

[[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D [[Raster graphics|bitmap graphics]] and 2D [[vector graphics]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=165}} This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, [[Interpolation|interpolated]] [[morphing]],{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=32, 70, 132}} [[onion skinning]]{{sfn|Priebe|2006|pp=71â€“72}} and interpolated rotoscoping.
2D animation has many applications, including After Effects Animation, [[Scanimate|analog computer animation]], [[Flash animation]], and [[PowerPoint animation]]. [[Cinemagraph]]s are [[Still life photography|still photographs]] in the form of an [[animated GIF]] file of which part is animated.{{sfn|White|2006|p=392}}

Final line [[advection]] animation is a technique used in 2D animation,{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|pp=246â€“47}} to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department.{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=127â€“28}} Speaking about using this approach in ''[[Paperman]]'', John Kahrs said that &quot;Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm.&quot;{{sfn|Beck|2012}}

====3D====
{{Main|Computer animation|3D computer graphics}}
[[File:Caminandes- Llama Drama - Short Movie.ogv|thumb|'''&lt;nowiki&gt;Caminandes | Llama Drama&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' ]]
3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The 3D model maker usually starts by creating a 3D [[polygon mesh]] for the animator to manipulate.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an [[Armature (computer animation)|armature]] that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=78â€“80}} This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with [[key frame]]s to create movement.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=285}}

Other techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and [[fluid animation|water simulations]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=96}} These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|p=92}}

=====Terms=====
* '''[[Cel shading]]''' is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cel Shading: the Unsung Hero of Animation?|url=http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|publisher=Animator Mag|access-date=20 February 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090445/http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|archive-date=5 March 2016|date=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shading looks stark, with less blending of colors. Examples include ''[[Skyland]]'' (2007, France), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999, United States), ''[[Futurama]]'' (1999, United States) ''[[Appleseed Ex Machina]]'' (2007, Japan), ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'' (2002, Japan), ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'' (2017, Japan)
* '''[[Machinima]]''' â€“ Films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds. The term originated from the software introduction in the 1980s [[demoscene]], as well as the 1990s recordings of the [[first-person shooter]] video game ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.
* '''[[Motion capture]]''' is used when live-action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into CG characters.{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=207â€“08}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=204}} Examples include ''[[The Polar Express (film)|Polar Express]]'' (2004, US), ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' (2007, US), ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' (2009, US), ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (2011, US) ''[[Kochadaiiyaan|kochadiiyan]]'' (2014, India)
* '''[[Computer animation]]''' is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life, using advanced rendering that mimics in detail skin, plants, water, fire, clouds, etc.{{sfn|Parent|2007|p=19}} Examples include ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009, US), ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (2010 film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010, US)
* '''[[Physically based animation]]''' is animation using [[computer simulation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald H. House|author2=John C.

===Mechanical===
* '''[[Animatronics]]''' is the use of [[mechatronics]] to create machines that seem animate rather than robotic.
** '''[[Audio-Animatronics]]''' is a form of [[robotics]] animation, combined with 3-D animation, created by [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] for shows and attractions at Disney theme parks move and make noise (generally a recorded speech or song).{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=249}} They are fixed to whatever supports them. They can sit and stand, and they cannot walk. An Audio-Animatron is different from an [[android (robot)|android]]-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics.{{sfn|O'Keefe|2014}}
** '''[[Linear alternator|Linear Animation Generator]]''' is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft. The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames.{{sfn|Parent|2007|pages=22â€“23}}
* '''[[Chuckimation]]''' is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series ''[[Action League Now!]]'' in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands.{{sfn|Kenyon|1998}}
* The '''[[Magic lantern|Magic Lantern]]''' used mechanical slides to project moving images. [[Christiaan Huygens]] was thought to have invented the Magic Lantern in the mid 1600â€™s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=About Magic Lanterns {{!}} Magic Lantern Society |url=https://www.magiclanternsociety.org/about-magic-lanterns/ |access-date=2024-04-24 |website=www.magiclanternsociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the [[Sun]] and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt. He is considered to be the most beautiful god and is represented as the ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth). Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''[[Apulu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, I. 2006. &quot;The Grave and Beyond.&quot; ''The Religion of the Etruscans.'' edited by N. de Grummond and E. Simon. Austin: University of Texas Press. p. vii, p. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the patron deity of [[Delphi]] (''Apollo Pythios''), Apollo is an [[oracular]] godâ€”the prophetic [[deity]] of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and also the deity of ritual purification. His oracles were often consulted for guidance in various matters. He was in general seen as the god who affords help and wards off evil, and is referred to as {{transliteration|grc|[[Alexicacus]]}}, the &quot;averter of evil&quot;.

Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]]. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows.

As the god of ''mousike'',{{efn|''Mousike'' (the art of the Muses) was an integral part of life in the ancient Greek world, and the term covered not only music but also dance, lyrics, theatre and the performance of poetry.}} Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance, and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common [[#Attributes and symbols|attribute of Apollo]]. Protection of the young is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As a {{transliteration|grc|[[kourotrophos]]}}, Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children, and he presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age ({{transliteration|grc|ephebeia}}) and dedicated to Apollo. The god himself is depicted with long, uncut hair to symbolise his eternal youth.

Apollo is an important pastoral deity, and he was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary rustic duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged the founding of new towns and the establishment of civil constitutions, is associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]], and was the giver of laws. His oracles were often consulted before setting laws in a city. Apollo [[Agyieus]] was the protector of the streets, public places and home entrances.

In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], the personification of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;For the iconography of the Alexanderâ€“Helios type, see H. Hoffmann, 1963. &quot;Helios&quot;, in ''Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt'' '''2''', pp. 117â€“23; cf. Yalouris 1980, no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin texts, however, there was no [[conflation]] of Apollo with [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]] among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose, &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Latin poets of the first century BC&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''30''' (1939), pp 439â€“55; &quot;Apollo and the Sun-God in Ovid&quot;, ''American Journal of Philology'' '''61''' (1940) pp 429â€“44; and &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Oaths of Aeneas and Latinus&quot; ''Classical Philology'' '''38'''.2 (April 1943), pp. 137â€“138.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.

The name ''Apollo''â€”unlike the related [[List of Mycenaean deities|older name]] ''[[Paean (god)|Paean]]''â€”is generally not found in the [[Linear B]] ([[Mycenean Greek]]) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]] form '']pe-rjo-['' (Linear B: ]{{lang|gmy|{{script|Linb|ð€ŸðŠ}}}}-[) on the [[Knossos|KN]] E 842 tablet,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S.

The [[etymology]] of the name is uncertain. The spelling {{lang|grc|á¼ˆÏ€ÏŒÎ»Î»Ï‰Î½}} ({{IPA-el|a.pÃ³l.lÉ”Ën|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the [[common era]], but the [[Dorians|Doric]] form, {{transliteration|grc|Apellon}} ({{lang|grc|á¼ˆÏ€Î­Î»Î»Ï‰Î½}}), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier {{lang|grc|*á¼ˆÏ€Î­Î»jÏ‰Î½}}. It probably is a cognate to the Doric month ''Apellaios'' ({{lang|grc|á¼ˆÏ€ÎµÎ»Î»Î±á¿–Î¿Ï‚}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Toorn |first1=Karel |last2=Becking |first2=Bob |last3=van der Horst |first3=Pieter Willem |title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHgUAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |year=1999 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-11119-6 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the offerings {{transliteration|grc|[[apellaia]]}} ({{lang|grc|á¼€Ï€ÎµÎ»Î»Î±á¿–Î±}}) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival {{transliteration|grc|apellai}} ({{lang|grc|á¼€Ï€Î­Î»Î»Î±Î¹}}).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The young men became grown-up {{transliteration|grc|[[kouros|kouroi]]}}, and Apollon was the {{transliteration|grc|megistos kouros}} (The Great Kouros) : Jane Ellen Harrison (2010): ''Themis: A study to the Social origins of Greek Religion'' Cambridge University Press. pp. 439â€“441, {{ISBN|1108009492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leiden |first1=E.

Nilsson, Vol I, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apella]] ({{lang|grc|á¼ˆÏ€Î­Î»Î»Î±}}) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta,&lt;ref name=Nilsson556/&gt; corresponding to the {{transliteration|grc|[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]}} ({{lang|grc|á¼ÎºÎºÎ»Î·ÏƒÎ¯Î±}}). [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P.

Several instances of [[popular etymology]] are attested by ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb {{lang|grc|á¼€Ï€ÏŒÎ»Î»Ï…Î¼Î¹}} ({{transliteration|grc|apollymi}}), &quot;to destroy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike |last=Campbell |url=http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=apollo |title=Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Apollo |publisher=Behind the Name |access-date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus]]'' connects the name with {{lang|grc|á¼€Ï€ÏŒÎ»Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚}} ({{transliteration|grc| apolysis}}), &quot;redemption&quot;, with {{lang|grc|á¼€Ï€ÏŒÎ»Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚}} (''apolousis''), &quot;purification&quot;, and with {{lang|grc|á¼Ï€Î»Î¿á¿¦Î½}} ({{transliteration|grc|[h]aploun}}), &quot;simple&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The {{lang|grc|á¼Ï€Î»Î¿á¿¦Î½}} suggestion is repeated by [[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' in the sense of &quot;[[1 (number)|unity]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, {{lang|grc|á¼ŒÏ€Î»Î¿Ï…Î½}}, and finally with {{lang|grc|á¼ˆÎµÎ¹Î²Î¬Î»Î»Ï‰Î½}} ({{transliteration|grc|aeiballon}}), &quot;ever-shooting&quot;. [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] connects the name Apollo with the Doric {{lang|grc|á¼€Ï€Î­Î»Î»Î±}} ({{transliteration|grc|apella}}), which means &quot;assembly&quot;, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation {{lang|grc|ÏƒÎ·ÎºÏŒÏ‚}} ({{transliteration|grc|sekos}}), &quot;fold&quot;, in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=184}} In the [[ancient Macedonian language]] {{lang|grc|Ï€Î­Î»Î»Î±}} ({{transliteration|grc|pella}}) means &quot;stone,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1168.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[toponyms]] may be derived from this word: {{lang|grc|Î Î­Î»Î»Î±}} ([[Pella]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pe/lla|Ï€Î­Î»Î»Î±|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the capital of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonia]]) and {{lang|grc|Î ÎµÎ»Î»Î®Î½Î·}} (''PellÄ“nÄ“''/''[[Pellene]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson Vol I, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] form ''[[Apaliunas]]'' (''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''{{lang|hit-Latn|x-ap-pa-li-u-na-aÅ¡}}) is attested in the [[Manapa-Tarhunta letter]].&lt;ref&gt;The reading of ''Apaliunas'' and the possible identification with Apollo is due to [[Emil Forrer]] (1931). It was doubted by [[Paul Kretschmer|Kretschmer]], ''Glotta'' XXIV, p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] testimony reflects an early form ''{{lang|grc-Latn|*ApeljÅn}}'', which may also be surmised from the comparison of Cypriot {{lang|grc|á¼ˆÏ€ÎµÎ¯Î»Ï‰Î½}} with Doric {{lang|grc|á¼ˆÏ€Î­Î»Î»Ï‰Î½}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Angel |first1=John L. |last2=Mellink |first2=Machteld Johanna | title = Troy and the Trojan War: A Symposium Held at Bryn Mawr College, October 1984| year = 1986| publisher = Bryn Mawr Commentaries| isbn = 978-0-929524-59-7| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the Lydian god ''QÎ»dÃ£ns'' /kÊ·ÊŽÃ°Ã£ns/ may reflect an earlier /kÊ·alyÃ¡n-/ before palatalization, syncope, and the pre-Lydian sound change *y ''&gt;'' d.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgQowuFZeLUC&amp;pg=PA338|title=Anatolian Historical Phonology|last=Melchert|first=Harold Craig|date=1994|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-9051836974|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric ''á¼ˆÏ€Î­Î»jÏ‰Î½'' and Hittite ''Apaliunas''.

===Greco-Roman epithets===
Apollo's chief [[epithet]] was '''Phoebus''' ({{IPAc-en|Ëˆ|f|iË|b|É™|s}} {{respell|FEE|bÉ™s}}; {{lang|grc|Î¦Î¿á¿–Î²Î¿Ï‚}}, ''Phoibos'' {{IPA-el|pÊ°Ã³Íœi.bos}}), literally &quot;bright&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1582.&lt;/ref&gt; It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo's role as the god of light. Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in [[Latin literature]].

The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to [[Artemis]], Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent [[Python (mythology)|Python]]. For the Greeks, Apollo was the most Greek of all the gods, and through the centuries he acquired different functions. In [[Archaic Greece]] he was the [[prophet]], the oracular god who in older times was connected with &quot;healing&quot;. In [[Classical Greece]] he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). &quot;Die Geschicte der Giechischen Religion, Vol I.&quot; C.F.Beck Verlag.Munchen. p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burkert]] discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed &quot;a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, Walter. ''Greek Religion'', 1985:144.&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical times, his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and he was therefore called &quot;apotropaios&quot; ({{lang|grc|á¼€Ï€Î¿Ï„ÏÏŒÏ€Î±Î¹Î¿Ï‚}}, &quot;averting evil&quot;) and &quot;alexikakos&quot; ({{lang|grc|á¼€Î»ÎµÎ¾Î¯ÎºÎ±ÎºÎ¿Ï‚}} &quot;keeping off ill&quot;; from [[verb|v.]] {{lang|grc|á¼€Î»Î­Î¾Ï‰}} + [[noun|n.]] {{lang|grc|ÎºÎ±ÎºÏŒÎ½}}).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias VIII 41, 8-IV 34, 7-Sittig.

Some commonly-used examples are &quot;paion&quot; ({{lang|grc|Ï€Î±Î¹ÏŽÎ½}} literally &quot;healer&quot; or &quot;helper&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0062:entry=paean-harpers]: Harper's Dictionary of classical antiquity&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;epikourios&quot; ({{lang|grc|á¼Ï€Î¹ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÎ¹Î¿Ï‚}}, &quot;succouring&quot;), &quot;oulios&quot; ({{lang|grc|Î¿á½”Î»Î¹Î¿Ï‚}}, &quot;healer, baleful&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ou)/lios|Î¿á½”Î»Î¹Î¿Ï‚|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;loimios&quot; ({{lang|grc|Î»Î¿Î¯Î¼Î¹Î¿Ï‚}}, &quot;of the plague&quot;). In later writers, the word, &quot;paion&quot;, usually spelled &quot;Paean&quot;, becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of [[healing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graf|first=Fritz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=it9n9_I-UOkC&amp;pg=PA66|title=Apollo|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2008|isbn=978-0-203-58171-1|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo in his aspect of &quot;healer&quot; has a connection to the primitive god [[Paean (god)|Paean]] ({{lang|grc|Î Î±Î¹ÏŽÎ½-Î Î±Î¹Î®Ï‰Î½}}), who did not have a cult of his own. Paean serves as the healer of the gods in the ''[[Iliad]]'', and seems to have originated in a pre-Greek religion.&lt;ref&gt;Paieon ({{lang|grc|Î Î±Î¹Î®Ï‰Î½}}) puts pain-relieving medicines on the wounds of Pluton and Ares ( [[Iliad|Ilias]] E401).

Homer illustrated Paeon the god and the song both of [[apotropaic]] thanksgiving or triumph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Homer |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2199|title=The Iliad|date=1 June 2000|language=en|translator-last=Butler|translator-first=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo and afterwards to other gods: to [[Dionysus]], to Apollo [[Helios]], to Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognized as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.

In the ''Iliad'', Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the [[Vedic]] god of disease [[Rudra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 541&quot;&gt;&quot;The conception that the diseases come from invisible shots sent by magicians or supernatural beings is common in primitive people and also in European folklore. In North-Europe they speak of the &quot;[[Elf-shot]]s&quot;. In Sweden where the Lapps were called magicians, they speak of the &quot;Lappen-shots&quot;. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; He sends a plague ({{lang|grc|Î»Î¿Î¹Î¼ÏŒÏ‚}}) to the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]. Knowing that Apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent, they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows, called a [[hecatomb]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad|Ilias]] A 314. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dorian origin===
The ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Apollo]]'' depicts Apollo as an intruder from the north.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Park (1956). ''The delphic oracle''. Vol. I, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The connection with the northern-dwelling [[Dorians]] and their initiation festival ''[[apellai]]'' is reinforced by the month ''Apellaios'' in northwest Greek calendars.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, ''Apollo'', pp. 104â€“113; Burkert also notes in this context [[Archilochus]] ''Fr''. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo ([[Dorians|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|á¼ˆÏ€Î­Î»Î»Ï‰Î½}}).&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sxurBtx6shoC&amp;pg=PA255 p. 255].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apellaios'' is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the &quot;megistos kouros&quot; (the great Kouros).&lt;ref&gt;Jane Ellen Harrison (2010): ''Themis: A study to the Social origins of Greek Religion''. Cambridge University Press. p. 441. {{ISBN|1108009492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the [[Ancient Macedonian language|Ancient Macedonian]] word &quot;pella&quot; ([[Pella]]), ''stone''. Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi ([[Omphalos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Compare: [[Baetylus]]. In Semitic: sacred stone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I. p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minoan origin===
[[File:AMI - Goldene Doppelaxt.jpg|thumb|250px|Ornamented golden [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[labrys]]]]
George Huxley regarded the identification of Apollo with the Minoan deity Paiawon, worshipped in Crete, to have originated at Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huxley|first=George|date=6 June 1975|title=Cretan Paiawones|url=https://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/view/8541|journal=Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=119â€“124|issn=2159-3159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Homeric Hymn'', Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. ''Apollo Delphinios'' or ''Delphidios'' was a sea-god especially worshipped in Crete and in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;554 A4&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's sister [[Artemis]], who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with [[Britomartis]] (Diktynna), the Minoan &quot;Mistress of the animals&quot;. In her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the &quot;Master of the animals&quot;, a bow-wielding god of hunting whose name has been lost; aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular Apollo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nilsson499&quot;&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, pp. 499â€“500&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatolian origin===
[[File:Coin of Apollo Agyieus.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of a coin of Apollo Agyieus from [[Ambracia]]]]
A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot; /&gt; The name of Apollo's mother [[Leto]] has [[Lydia]]n origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of [[Asia Minor]]. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from [[Anatolia]], which is the origin of [[Sibyl]], and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old [[Assyria|Assyro]]-[[Babylon]]ian texts. These rituals were spread into the empire of the [[Hittites]], and from there into Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nilsson563&quot;&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|Martin Nilsson]]. ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion Vol I'', pp. 563â€“564&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homer]] pictures Apollo on the side of the [[Troy|Trojans]], fighting against the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], during the [[Trojan War]]. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to ''Appaliunas'', a tutelary god of [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kretschmer]] (1936). Glotta XXIV p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; The stones found in front of the gates of [[Homer]]ic Troy were the symbols of Apollo. A western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of ''Artimus'' ([[Artemis]]) and ''QÎ»dÃ£ns'', whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms, in surviving [[Lydian language|Lydian]] texts''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ediana.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/corpus.php|title=EDIANA â€“ Corpus|website=www.ediana.gwi.uni-muenchen.de|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of ''QÎ»dÃ£ns'' with Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sardisexpedition.org/en/essays/latw-greenewalt-gods-of-lydia|title=The Archaeological Exploration of Sardis|website=sardisexpedition.org|language=en|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks gave to him the name {{lang|grc|á¼€Î³Ï…Î¹ÎµÏÏ‚}} ''[[agyieus]]'' as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion.'' vol. I (C. H. Beck), 1955:563f.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the [[full moon]], all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated on the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (''sibutu'') indicates a [[Babylonia]]n origin.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proto-Indo-European ===
&lt;!-- Unless there are reliable secondary sources which make this connection, this should not be here. --&gt;
The [[Vedic]] [[Rudra]] has some similar functions to Apollo. The terrible god is called &quot;the archer&quot; and the bow is also an attribute of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;For {{IAST|Åšarva}} as a name of Shiva see: Apte, p.&amp;nbsp;910.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them and his alternative Shiva is a healer physician god.&lt;ref&gt;For the association between Rudra and disease, with Rigvedic references, see: Bhandarkar, p.&amp;nbsp;146.&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.

==Oracular cult==

[[File:Herakles tripod Louvre F341.jpg|thumb|250px|Oracular tripod]] 
Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: [[Delos]] and [[Delphi]]. In cult practice, [[Delos|Delian Apollo]] and [[Pythian Apollo]] (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert 1985:143&quot;/&gt; [[Lycia]] was sacred to the god, for this Apollo was also called Lycian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/133#5.77.5 Diodorus Siculus, Library 1â€“7, 5.77.5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.77 Diodorus Siculus, Library 1â€“7, 5.77.5 â€“ GR]&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's [[Cult (religion)|cult]] was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], and the frequency of [[theophoric names]] such as ''Apollodorus'' or ''Apollonios'' and cities named ''Apollonia'' testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at [[Didyma]] and [[Claros]] pronounced the so-called &quot;theological oracles&quot;, in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an [[Monism#Monism, pantheism, and panentheism|all-encompassing, highest deity]]. &quot;In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. [[Julian the Apostate]] (359â€“361) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot; /&gt;

===Oracular shrines===
[[File:Delos lions.jpg|thumb|250px|Delos lions]]
Apollo had a famous [[oracle]] in Delphi, and other notable ones in [[Claros]] and [[Didyma]]. His oracular shrine in [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]], where he bore the [[toponym]]ic epithet ''[[Abaeus]]'' ({{lang|grc|á¼ˆÏ€ÏŒÎ»Î»Ï‰Î½ á¼ˆÎ²Î±á¿–Î¿Ï‚}}, ''Apollon Abaios''), was important enough to be consulted by [[Croesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], 1.46.&lt;/ref&gt;
His oracular shrines include:

* [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]].
* [[Bassae]] in the [[Peloponnese]].
* At [[Clarus]], on the west coast of [[Asia Minor]]; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a ''pneuma'', from which the priests drank.
* In [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of [[Tenea]], from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.
* At [[Khyrse]], in [[Troad]], the temple was built for Apollo Smintheus.
* In [[Delos]], there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer. The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.
* In [[Delphi]], the [[Pythia]] became filled with the ''[[pneuma]]'' of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the [[Adyton]].
* In [[Didyma]], an oracle on the coast of [[Anatolia]], south west of [[Lydia]]n ([[Luwian]]) [[Sardis]], in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple. Was believed to have been founded by [[Branchus]], son or lover of Apollo.
* In [[Manbij|Hierapolis Bambyce]], Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise ''[[De Dea Syria]]'', the sanctuary of the [[Atargatis|Syrian Goddess]] contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo. Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]] (attrib.), ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/tsg/tsg07.htm#35 35â€“37].&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Patara (Lycia)|Patara]], in [[Lycia]], there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos. As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.
* In [[Segesta]] in Sicily.

Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.
* In [[Oropus]], north of [[Athens]], the oracle [[Amphiaraus]], was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.
* in Labadea, {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Delphi, [[Trophonius]], another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.

==Temples of Apollo==

[[File:The Temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassae, east colonnade, Arcadia, Greece (14087181020).jpg|250px|thumb|Partial view of the temple of Apollo Epikurios (healer) at [[Bassae]] in southern Greece]]

Many temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies. They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in [[Crete]], do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered [[divinity|divine]], and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of [[Doric order]]. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be [[Canon (basic principle)|canonic]], and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection.&lt;ref&gt;To know what a thing is, we must know the look of it&quot;: Rhys Carpenter: ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of [[Pythagoras]], who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.&lt;ref name=&quot;C. M. Bowra 1957 p. 166&quot;&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957), ''The Greek Experience'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doric order]] dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn't be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the [[Ionic order]], but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the [[Corinthian order]] gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.

The most important temples are:

*[[Thebes, Greece]]: The oldest temple probably dedicated to ''Apollo Ismenius'' was built in the 9th century BC. It seems that it was a curvilinear building. The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built in the early 7th century BC, but only some small parts have been found.&lt;ref&gt;William Dinsmoor (1950),''The architecture of Ancient Greece'', p. 218, {{ISBN|0-8196-0283-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival called [[Daphnephoria]] was celebrated every ninth year in honour of Apollo Ismenius (or Galaxius). The people held laurel branches (daphnai), and at the head of the procession walked a youth (chosen priest of Apollo), who was called &quot;daphnephoros&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;William Smith 1875. p. 384&quot;&gt;William Smith.'' A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', John Murray, London, 1875. p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eretria]]: According to the Homeric hymn to Apollo, the god arrived on the plain, seeking for a location to establish its oracle. The first temple of ''Apollo Daphnephoros'', &quot;Apollo, laurel-bearer&quot;, or &quot;carrying off Daphne&quot;, is dated to 800 BC. The temple was curvilinear ''hecatombedon'' (a hundred feet). In a smaller building were kept the bases of the laurel branches which were used for the first building. Another temple probably peripteral was built in the 7th century BC, with an inner row of wooden columns over its Geometric predecessor. It was rebuilt peripteral around 510 BC, with the [[stylobate]] measuring 21,00 x 43,00 m. The number of [[pteron]] column was 6 x 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1689 Hellenic Ministry of culture, Temple of Apollo Daphnephoros] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912212901/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1689 |date=12 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rufus B.

*[[Dreros]] ([[Crete]]). The temple of ''Apollo Delphinios'' dates from the 7th century BC, or probably from the middle of the 8th century BC. According to the legend, Apollo appeared as a dolphin, and carried Cretan priests to the port of [[Delphi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 529&quot;&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967).

*[[Gortyn]] ([[Crete]]). A temple of ''Pythian Apollo'', was built in the 7th century BC. The plan measured 19,00 x 16,70 m and it was not peripteral. The walls were solid, made from limestone, and there was a single door on the east side.
*[[Thermon]] ([[West Greece]]): The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of ''Apollo Thermios'', was built in the middle of the 7th century BC. It was built on an older curvilinear building dating perhaps from the 10th century, on which a [[peristyle]] was added. The temple was narrow, and the number of pteron columns (probably wooden) was 5 x 15. There was a single row of inner columns. It measures 12.13 x 38.23 m at the stylobate, which was made from stones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spivey, p. 112&quot;&gt;Spivey, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Syracuse, Sicily]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built at the beginning of the 6th century BC. The temple's [[stylobate]] measures 21.47 x 55.36 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. It was the first temple in Greek west built completely out of stone. A second row of columns were added, obtaining the effect of an inner porch.&lt;ref&gt;Mertens 2006, pp. 104â€“109.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Selinus]] ([[Sicily]]):The [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Temple C (Selinus)|Temple C]] dates from 550 BC, and it was probably dedicated to Apollo.

*[[Delphi]]: The first temple dedicated to Apollo, was built in the 7th century BC. According to the legend, it was wooden made of laurel branches. The &quot;Temple of Alcmeonidae&quot; was built in {{circa|513 BC}}  and it is the oldest Doric temple with significant marble elements. The temple's stylobate measures 21.65 x 58.00 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-temple-of-apollo.html Temple of Apollo at Delphi], Ancient-Greece.org&lt;/ref&gt; A fest similar with Apollo's fest at [[Thebes, Greece]] was celebrated every nine years.

==Mythology==
{{Main|Greek mythology}}
In the myths, Apollo is the son of [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, and [[Leto]], his previous wife&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D21%3Acard%3D468 21.499]&lt;/ref&gt; or one of his mistresses. Apollo often appears in the myths, plays and hymns either directly or indirectly through his oracles. As Zeus' favorite son, he had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans. A divinity beyond human comprehension, he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god.

===Birth===
[[File:Metropolitan Richart Latona.jpg|thumb|Leto with her children, by [[William Henry Rinehart]]]]

====Homeric Hymn to Apollo====

Pregnant with the offsprings of Zeus, Leto wandered through many lands wanting to give birth to Apollo. However all the lands rejected her out of fear. Upon reaching Delos, Leto requested the island to shelter her, and that in return her son would bring fame and prosperity to the island. Delos then revealed to Leto that Apollo was rumoured to be the god who will &quot;greatly lord it among gods and men all over the fruitful earth&quot;. For this reason, all the lands were fearful and Delos feared that Apollo would cast her aside once he is born. Hearing this, Leto swore on the river Styx that if she is allowed to give birth on the island, her son would honour Delos the most amongst all the other lands. Assured by this, Delos agreed to assist Leto. All goddesses except Hera also came to aid Leto.

However, Hera had tricked [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth, to stay on Olympus, due to which Leto was unable to give birth. The goddesses then convinced Iris to go bring Eileithyia by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards (8.2 m) long. Iris did accordingly and persuaded Eileithyia to step onto the island. Thus, clutching a palm tree, Leto finally gave birth after labouring for nine days and nine nights, with Apollo &quot;leaping forth&quot; from his mother's womb. The goddesses washed the new born, covered him in a white garment and fastened golden bands around him. As Leto was unable to feed him, [[Themis]], the goddess of divine law, fed him nectar and [[ambrosia]]. Upon tasting the divine food, the child broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of [[lyre]] and archery, and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind. He then started to walk, which caused the island to be filled with gold.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Homeric hymn to Delian Apollo&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Callimachus' hymn to Delos====
[[File:Capitello con busto di apollo, periodo ellenistico, da didyma.jpg|thumb|right|Hellenistic bust of Apollo from [[Didyma]], [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]

The island Delos used to be [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], a goddess who jumped into the waters to escape the advances of Zeus and became a free-floating island of the same name. When Leto got pregnant, Hera was told that Leto's son would become more dear to Zeus than Ares. Enraged by this, Hera watched over the heavens and sent out Ares and Iris to prevent Leto from giving birth on the earth. Ares, stationed over the mainland, and Iris, over the islands, threatened all the lands and prevented them from helping Leto.

When Leto arrived at Thebes, fetal Apollo prophesied from his mother's womb that in the future he would punish a slanderous woman in Thebes ([[Niobe]]), so he did not want to be born there. Leto then went to Thessaly and sought the help of the river nymphs who were the daughters of the river Peneus. Though he was initially fearful and reluctant, Peneus later decided to let Leto give birth in his waters. He did not change his mind even when Ares produced a terrifying sound and threatened to hurl mountain peaks into the river. But Leto herself declined his help and departed, as she did not want him to suffer for her sake.

After being turned away from various lands, Apollo spoke again from the womb, asking his mother to take look at the floating island in front of her and expressing his wish to be born there. When Leto approached Asteria, all the other islands fled. But Asteria welcomed Leto without any fear of Hera. Walking on the island, she sat down against a palm tree and asked Apollo to be born. During the childbirth, swans circled the island seven times, a sign that later on Apollo would play the seven-stringed lyre. When Apollo finally &quot;leapt forth&quot; from his mother's womb, the nymphs of the island sang a hymn to Eileithyia that was heard to the heavens. The moment Apollo was born, the entire island, including the trees and the waters, became gold. Asteria bathed the newborn, swaddled him and fed him with her breast milk. The island had become rooted and was later called Delos.

Hera was no longer angry, as Zeus had managed to calm her down; and she held no grudge against Asteria, since Asteria had rejected Zeus in the past.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Delos''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Latona with Her Children Apollo and Diana LACMA M.78.86.jpg|thumb|Leto holding Apollo, by Lazar Widmann|left]]

====Pindar's fragments====

Pindar is the earliest source who explicitly calls Apollo and Artemis as twins. Here, Asteria is also stated to be Leto's sister. Wanting to escape Zeus' advances, she flung herself into the sea and became a floating rock called Ortygia until the twins were born.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Pa. VII b''&lt;/ref&gt; When Leto stepped on the rock, four pillars with adamantine bases rose from the earth and held up the rock.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Processional Song on Delos''&lt;/ref&gt; When Apollo and Artemis were born, their bodies shone radiantly and a chant was sung by Eileithyia and [[Lachesis]], one of the  three [[Moirai]].&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Pa. XII''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pseudo-Hyginus====

Scorning the advances of Zeus, Asteria transformed herself into a bird and jumped into a sea. From her, an island rose which was called Ortygia.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Hyginus, ''Fabulae 53''&lt;/ref&gt; 
When Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant with Zeus' child, she decreed that Leto can give birth only in a place where sun does not shine. During this time, the monster Python also started hounding Leto with an intent of killing her, because he had foreseen his death coming at the hands of Leto's offspring. However, on Zeus' orders, [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] carried away Leto and entrusted her to [[Poseidon]]. To protect her, Poseidon took her to the island Ortygia and covered it with waves so that the sun would not shine on it. Leto gave birth clinging to an olive tree and henceforth the island was called Delos.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' ''140''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Latona with the infants Apollo and Artemis, by Francesco Pozzi, 1824, marble - Sculpture Gallery, Chatsworth House - Derbyshire, England - DSC03504.jpg|thumb|Leto with Apollo and Artemis, by [[Francesco Pozzi]]]]

Other variations of Apollo's birth include:

Aelian states that it took Leto twelve days and twelve nights to travel from Hyperborea to Delos.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Characteristics of Animals 4. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; Leto changed herself into a she-wolf before giving birth. This is given as the reason why Homer describes Apollo as the &quot;wolf-born god&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Characteristics of Animals 10. 26''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad''&lt;/ref&gt;

Libanius wrote that neither land nor visible islands would receive Leto, but by the will of Zeus Delos then became visible, and thus received Leto and the children.&lt;ref&gt;Libanius, ''Progymnasmata 2.25''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Strabo, the [[Curetes (tribe)|Curetes]] helped Leto by creating loud noises with their weapons and thus frightening Hera, they concealed Leto's childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography 14. 1. 20''&lt;/ref&gt;

Theognis wrote that the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance when Apollo was born, and the Earth laughed with joy.&lt;ref&gt;Theognis, ''Fragment 1. 5''&lt;/ref&gt;

While in some accounts Apollo's birth itself fixed the floating Delos to the earth, there are accounts of Apollo securing Delos to the bottom of the ocean a little while later.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0052%3Abook%3D3%3Acard%3D69 3.80]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca''&lt;/ref&gt; 
This island became sacred to Apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god.
Apollo was born on the seventh day ({{lang|grc|á¼‘Î²Î´Î¿Î¼Î±Î³ÎµÎ½Î®Ï‚}}, ''hebdomagenes'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e(bdomagenh/s|á¼‘Î²Î´Î¿Î¼Î±Î³ÎµÎ½Î®Ï‚|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the month [[Attic calendar#Festival calendar (lunisolar)|Thargelion]]â€”according to Delian traditionâ€”or of the month [[Hellenic calendars#Delphic|Bysios]]â€”according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=184}}

The general consensus is that [[Artemis]] was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Servius, ''Commentary on Virgil's Aeneid 3.7''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orphic Hymn 35 to Leto, 3â€“5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyperborea===
[[File:Antalya_Museum_06022022_009.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo head in the [[Antalya Museum]], [[Turkey]]]]

[[Hyperborea]], the mystical land of eternal spring, venerated Apollo above all the gods. The Hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted [[Pythian games]].&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Pindar, Olympian Ode&lt;/ref&gt; There, a vast forest of beautiful trees was called &quot;the garden of Apollo&quot;. Apollo spent the winter months among the Hyperboreans,&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''[[Argonautica]]'', [https://archive.org/details/argonautica00apoluoft/page/148/mode/2up?view=theater 2. 674].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; leaving his shrine in Delphi under the care of Dionysus. His absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death. No prophecies were issued during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origins''&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the world during the beginning of the spring. The ''Theophania'' festival was held in [[Delphi]] to celebrate his return.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''de his qui sero a num. pun.'' p. 557F&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Diodorus Silculus states that Apollo visited Hyperborea every nineteen years. This nineteen-year period was called by the Greeks as the â€˜year of Meton', the time period in which the stars returned to their initial positions. And that visiting Hyperborea at that time, Apollo played on the cithara and danced continuously from the vernal equinox until the rising of the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]] (constellations).&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, ''Library of History'' 2. 47. 1 â€“ 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperborea was also Leto's birthplace. It is said that Leto came to Delos from Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves. Henceforth, Hyperborea became Apollo's winter home and wolves became sacred to him. His intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet ''Lyceus'', meaning ''wolf-like''. But Apollo was also the wolf-slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators. The Hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks of Apollo being worshipped as the sun god. Shamanistic elements in Apollo's cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin, and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Afonasina, ''Shamanism and the Orphic tradition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Graf, ''Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; Shamans like [[Abaris]] and [[Aristeas]] were also the followers of Apollo, who hailed from Hyperborea.

In myths, the tears of amber Apollo shed when his son Asclepius died mixed with the waters of the river Eridanos, which surrounded Hyperborea. Apollo also buried in Hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the [[Cyclopes]]. He later gave this arrow to Abaris.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''[[Argonautica]]'', [https://archive.org/details/argonautica00apoluoft/page/334/mode/2up?view=theater 4. 594].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and youth===

Growing up, Apollo was nursed by the nymphs Korythalia and [[Aletheia (disambiguation)|Aletheia]], the personification of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Moralia'' 657e&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phoebe (Titaness)|Phoebe]], his grandmother, gave the oracular shrine of [[Delphi]] to Apollo as a birthday gift.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceG&quot;&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

As a four-year-old child, Apollo built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted. Since he learnt the art of building when young, he came to be known as [[Archegetes]], (''the founder of towns'') and guided men to build new cities.&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; To keep the child amused, the Delian nymphs ran around the altar beating it, and then with their hands tied behind their backs, bit an olive branch. It later became a custom for all the sailors who passed by the island to do the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus, Hymn to Delos&quot;&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Delos''&lt;/ref&gt;

From his father Zeus, Apollo received a golden headband and a chariot driven by swans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcaeus, Hymn to Apollo&quot;&gt;Alcaeus, ''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceF&quot;&gt;Timothy P. Bridgman, ''Hyperboreans: Myth and History in Celtic-Hellenic Contacts''&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early years when Apollo spent his time herding cows, he was reared by the [[Thriae]], who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn]] 4 to [[Hermes]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D4%3Acard%3D550 550].&lt;/ref&gt; The god Pan was also said to mentored him in the prophetic art.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.41.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo is also said to have invented the lyre, and along with Artemis, the art of archery. He then taught the humans the art of healing and archery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5D*.html#74.5 5.74.5].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lycian peasants====

[[File:Joshua Cristall - Latona and the Lycian Peasants - 96.1210 - Museum of Fine Arts.jpg|thumb|Latona and the Lycian peasants, by [[Joshua Cristall]]]]

Soon after giving birth to her twins, Leto fled from Delos fearing Hera. Upon reaching Lycia, her infants had drained all of their mother's milk and cried for more to satisfy their hunger. The exhausted mother then tried drinking from a nearby lake but was stopped by some [[Lycian peasants]]. When she begged them to let her quench her thirst, the haughty peasants not only threatened her but also stirred the mud in the lake to dirty the waters. Angered by this, Leto turned them into frogs.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 6. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

In a slightly varied version, Leto took her infants and crossed over to Lycia where she attempted to bathe her children in a spring she found there. But the local herdsmen drove her away. After that, some wolves found Leto and guided her to the river Xanthos, where Leto was able to bathe her children and quench her thirst. She then returned to the spring and turned the herdsmen into frogs.&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus Liberalis, ''Metamorphoses'' 35&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slaying of Python====

[[File:7003.Apollo mit dem getÃ¶teten Python(1752)-FranÃ§ois Gaspard Adam-GroÃŸe FontÃ¤ne-Sanssouci Steffen Heilfort.JPG|thumb|190px|Apollo victorious over the Python, by [[FranÃ§ois Gaspard Adam]]|left]]

[[Python (mythology)|Python]], a [[chthonic]] serpent-dragon, was a child of Gaia and the guardian of the [[Delphic Oracle]].
In the Callimachus' hymn to Delos, fetal Apollo foresees the death of Python at his hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus, Hymn to Delos&quot;/&gt;

In the Homeric hymn to Apollo, Python was a female drakon and the nurse of the giant [[Typhon]] whom Hera had created to overthrow Zeus. She was described as a terrifying monster and a &quot;bloody plague&quot;. Apollo, in his pursuit to establish his worship, came across Python and killed her with a single arrow shot from his bow. He let the corpse rot under the sun and declared himself the oracular deity of Delphi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homeric hymn to Apollo&quot;&gt;''Homeric hymn to Pythian Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have Apollo kill the monster using a hundred arrows&lt;ref&gt;Simonides, Fragment 573&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Thebaid'' 5. 531&lt;/ref&gt; or a thousand arrows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ovid, Metamorphoses 1. 434&quot;&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 1. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Artus Quellinus, Apollo en Python- Apollon et Python, KBS-FRB.jpg|thumb|right|''Apollo and Python'', terracotta relief by [[Artus Quellinus the Elder]] (1609â€“1668)]]

According to Euripides, Leto had brought her twins to the cliffs of Parnassus shortly after giving birth to them. Upon seeing the monster there, Apollo, still a child being carried in his mother's arms, leapt forth and killed Python.&lt;ref&gt;Euripides, ''Iphigenia in Tauris'' 1234&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors also mention that Python was killed for displaying lustful affections towards Leto.&lt;ref&gt;Limenus, ''Paean to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greek Anthology, 3.6&lt;/ref&gt;

In another account, Python chased pregnant Leto with an intent of killing her because his death was fated to come at the hands of Leto's child. However, he had to stop the chase when Leto came under the protection of Poseidon. After his birth, four days old Apollo killed the serpent with the bow and arrows gifted to him by Hephaestus and avenged the trouble given to his mother. The god then put the bones of the slain monster in a cauldron and deposited it in his temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 140&quot;&gt;Pseudo-Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 140&lt;/ref&gt;

This legend is also narrated as the origin of the cry &quot;''HiÃ« paian''&quot;. According to Athenaeus, Pyhton attacked Leto and her twins during their visit to Delphi. Taking Artemis into her arms, Leto climbed upon a rock and cried at Apollo to shoot the monster. The cry let out by her, &quot;Î¹Îµ, Ï€Î±á¿–&quot; (&quot;Shoot, boy&quot;) later got slightly altered as &quot;á¼°á½´ Ï€Î±Î¹ÏŽÎ½&quot; (''HiÃ« paian''), an exclamation to avert evils.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophists'' 15.62&lt;/ref&gt; Callimachus attributes the origin of this phrase to the Delphians, who let out the cry to encourage Apollo when the young god battled with Python.&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Apollo'' 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Strabo has recorded a slightly different version where Python was actually a cruel and lawless man who was also known by the name &quot;Drakon&quot;. When Apollo was teaching the humans to cultivate fruits and civilise themselves, the residents of Parnassus complained to the god about Python. In response to their pleas, Apollo killed the man with his arrows. During the fight, the Parnassians shouted ''&quot;HiÃ« paian&quot;'' to encourage the god.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo, Geography 9. 3. 12&quot;&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' 9. 3. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

====Establishment of worship in Delphi====

Continuing from his victory over Python, the Homeric hymn describes how the young god established his worship among the humans. As Apollo was pondering about what kind of men he should recruit to serve him, he spotted a ship full of Cretan merchants or pirates. He took the form of a dolphin and sprang aboard the ship. Whenever the oblivious crew members tried throwing the dolphin overboard, the god shook the ship until the crew was awed into submission. Apollo then created a breeze that directed the ship to Delphi. Upon reaching the land, he revealed himself as a god and initiated them as his priests. He instructed them to guard his temple and always keep righteousness in their hearts.&lt;ref&gt;Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcaeus narrates the following account: Zeus, who had adorned his newborn son with a golden headband, also provided him with a chariot driven by swans and instructed Apollo to visit Delphi to establish his laws among the people. But Apollo disobeyed his father and went to the land of [[Hyperborea]]. The Delphians continuously sung paeans in his honour and pleaded him to come back to them. The god returned only after a year and then carried out Zeus' orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcaeus, Hymn to Apollo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Himerius, ''Orations''&lt;/ref&gt;

In other variations, the shrine at Delphi was simply handed over to Apollo by his grandmother Phoebe as a gift,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceG&quot;/&gt; or Themis herself inspired him to be the oracular voice of Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0006 1]; ''[[Orphic Hymn]]'' 79 ''to Themis''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Flaxman - To Phoebus at His Birth, From Aeschylus, Furies - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Phoebe (Titaness)|Phoebe]] gifts the oracular tripod to Apollo, by [[John Flaxman]]]]

However, in many other accounts, Apollo had to overcome certain obstacles before he was able to establish himself at Delphi. Gaea came in conflict with Apollo for killing Python and claiming the Delphic oracle for himself. According to Pindar, she sought to banish Apollo to Tartarus as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, fr. 55 SM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry, W.B. â€œ(I.) Rutherford Pindar's Paeans. A Reading of the Fragments with a Survey of the Genre&lt;/ref&gt; According to Euripides, soon after Apollo took the ownership of the oracle, Gaea started sending prophetic dreams to the humans. As a result, people stopped visiting Delphi to obtain prophecies. Troubled by this, Apollo went to Olympus and supplicated to Zeus. Zeus, admiring the ambitions of his young son, granted his request by putting an end to the dream visions. This sealed the role of Apollo as the oracular deity of Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;Euripides, ''Iphigenia in Tauris'' 1259&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Apollo had committed a blood crime, he also had to be purified. Pausanias has recorded two of the many variations of this purification. In one of them, both Apollo and Artemis fled to Sicyon and were purified there.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 2. 7. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In the other tradition that had been prevalent among the Cretans, Apollo alone travelled to Crete and was purified by [[Carmanor (of Crete)|Carmanor]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 2. 30. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In another account, the Argive king [[Crotopus]] was the one who performed the purification rites on Apollo alone.&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Thebaid'' 1. 561&lt;/ref&gt;

According the Aristonous and Aelian, Apollo was purified by the will of Zeus in the [[Vale of Tempe]].&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Varia'' ''Historia'' 3.1&lt;/ref&gt; Aristonous has continued the tale, saying that Apollo was escorted back to Delphi by Athena. As a token of gratitude, he later built a temple for Athena at Delphi, which served as a threshold for his own temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Temple of Athena Pronaia]] was the first one met by the visitor who came to Delphi on foot from the eastern road.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reaching Delphi, Apollo convinced Gaea and Themis into handing over the seat of oracle to him. To celebrate this event, other immortals also graced Apollo with gifts â€“ Poseidon gave him the land of Delphi, the Delphian nymphs gifted him the Corycian cave, and Artemis set her dogs to patrol and safeguard the land.&lt;ref&gt;Aristonous, ''Paean to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some others have also said that Apollo was exiled and subjected to servitude under king [[Admetus]] as a means of punishment for the murder he had committed.&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast on Euripides, Alcestis. 1 citing Anaxandrides&lt;/ref&gt; It was when he was serving as a cowherd under Admetus that the theft of the cattle by Hermes happened.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, The Great Eoiae Fragment 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus Liberalis, ''Metamorphoses'' 23&lt;/ref&gt; The servitude was said to have lasted for either one year,&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' 10.1.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 3.10.4&lt;/ref&gt; or one great year (a cycle of eight years),&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Amatorius'' 761e&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 3.4.2&lt;/ref&gt; or nine years.&lt;ref&gt;Servius, ''Commentary on Aeneid'' 2.761&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch, however, has mentioned a variation where Apollo was neither purified in Tempe nor banished to Earth as a servant for nine years, but was driven out to another world for nine great years. The god who returned was cleansed and purified, thus becoming a &quot;true Phoebus â€“ that is to say, clear and bright&quot;. He then took over the Delphic oracle, which had been under the care of Themis in his absence.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Why the Oracles Cease To Give Answers'' 421c&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder, made men aware of their guilt and purified them.&lt;ref&gt;Apollo, Fritz Graf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pythian games were also established by Apollo, either as funeral games to honor Python&lt;ref name=&quot;Pseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 140&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceE&quot;/&gt; or to celebrate his own victory.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' 9. 3. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Thebaid'' 6. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ovid, Metamorphoses 1. 434&quot;/&gt; The [[Pythia]] was Apollo's high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies.

====Tityus====

[[File:Apollo Tityos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2689.jpg|thumb|Apollo slaying [[Tityos]], Attic red-figure kylix, 460â€“450 BC]]

[[Tityos|Tityus]] was another giant who tried to rape Leto, either on his own accord when she  was on her way to Delphi&lt;ref name=&quot;Homer, Odyssey 11. 576&quot;&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 11. 576&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1.22&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.22&lt;/ref&gt; or at the order of Hera.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 55&lt;/ref&gt; Leto called upon on her children who instantly slew the giant. Apollo, still a young boy, shot him with his arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica'' 1. 758&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quintus Smyrnaeus, ''Fall of Troy'' 3. 390&lt;/ref&gt;  In some accounts, Artemis also joined him in protecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia on [[Pindar]], ''Pythian Odes'' 4.160 citing Pherecydes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 10. 11. 1&lt;/ref&gt; For this act, he was banished to Tartarus and there he was pegged to the rock floor and stretched on an area of {{convert|9|acre|m2}}, while a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver&lt;ref name=&quot;Homer, Odyssey 11. 576&quot;/&gt; or his heart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1.22&quot;/&gt;

Another account recorded by Strabo says that Tityus was not a giant but a lawless man whom Apollo killed at the request of the residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo, Geography 9. 3. 12&quot;/&gt;

===Admetus===
[[File:Drawing, Apollo Guards the Herds (or Flocks) of King Admetus, 1780â€“1800 (CH 18122047).jpg|thumb|Apollo guards the herds (or flocks) of King [[Admetus]], by [[Felice Giani|Felice Gianni]]]]

[[Admetus]] was the king of [[Pherae]], who was known for his hospitality. When Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python, he served as a herdsman under Admetus, who was then young and unmarried. Apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Callimachus]], Hymn II to Apollo.&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his years of servitude, Apollo went back to Olympus as a god.

Because Admetus had treated Apollo well, the god conferred great benefits on him in return. Apollo's mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins.&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-3-10-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Apollo helped Admetus win the hand of [[Alcestis]], the daughter of [[Pelias|King Pelias]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-1-9-15&quot;&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9%3Asection%3D15 1.9.15].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hyginus-50&quot;&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#50 50â€“51].&lt;/ref&gt; by taming a lion and a boar to draw Admetus' chariot. He was present during their wedding to give his blessings. When Admetus angered the goddess Artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings, Apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-1-9-15&quot; /&gt; When Apollo learnt of Admetus' untimely death, he convinced or tricked the [[Moirai|Fates]] into letting Admetus live past his time.&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-1-9-15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hyginus-50&quot; /&gt;

According to another version, or perhaps some years later, when Zeus struck down Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead, Apollo in revenge killed the [[Cyclopes]], who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-3-10-4&quot;&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D10%3Asection%3D4 3.10.4].&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo would have been banished to [[Tartarus]] for this, but his mother [[Leto]] intervened, and reminding Zeus of their old love, pleaded with him not to kill their son. Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of [[Penal labour|hard labor]] once again under Admetus.&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-3-10-4&quot; /&gt;

The love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored topic of Roman poets like [[Ovid]] and [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]].

===Niobe===
[[File:Pierre-Charles Jombert - Les enfants de NiobÃ© tuÃ©s par Apollon et Diane.JPG|thumb|286x286px|Niobe's children are killed by Apollo and Diana, by [[Pierre-Charles Jombert]]]]

The fate of [[Niobe]] was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto's womb.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Niobe was the queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]]. She displayed [[hubris]] when she boasted that she was superior to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo's effeminate appearance and Artemis' manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe's sons, and Artemis her daughters. According to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.

A devastated Niobe fled to [[Spil Mount|Mount Sipylos]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]]. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

When Chloris married and had children, Apollo granted her son [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] the years he had taken away from the Niobids. Hence, Nestor was able to live for 3 generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building the walls of Troy ===

[[File:Sandrart (attributed), Troppa (attr.) - Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo - 17th c.jpg|thumb|left|Laomedon refusing payment to Poseidon and Apollo, by [[Joachim von Sandrart]]]]

Once Apollo and [[Poseidon]] served under the Trojan king [[Laomedon]] in accordance with Zeus' words. Apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of Mount Ida, while Poseidon built the walls of Troy.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D21%3Acard%3D434 21.434]&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions make both Apollo and Poseidon the builders of the wall. In Ovid's account, Apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre.

In [[Pindar]]'s odes, the gods took a mortal named [[Aeacus]] as their assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' viii. 39, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; When the work was completed, three snakes rushed against the wall, and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus. Apollo immediately prophesied that [[Troy]] would fall at the hands of Aeacus's descendants, the [[Aeacidae]] (i.e. his son Telamon joined [[Heracles]] when he sieged the city during Laomedon's rule. Later, his great-grandson [[Neoptolemus]] was present in the wooden horse that leads to the downfall of Troy).

However, the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised, but also threatened to bind their feet and hands, and sell them as slaves. Angered by the unpaid labour and the insults, Apollo infected the city with a pestilence and Poseidon sent the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. To deliver the city from it, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter [[Hesione]] (who would later be saved by [[Heracles]]).

During his stay in Troy, Apollo had a lover named Ourea, who was a nymph and daughter of Poseidon. Together they had a son named Ileus, whom Apollo loved dearly.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;Hesiod, ''Catalogues of Women'' Fragment 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trojan War===

Apollo sided with the Trojans during the [[Trojan War]] waged by the Greeks against the Trojans.

During the war, the Greek king [[Agamemnon]] captured [[Chryseis]], the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]], and refused to return her. Angered by this, Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment. He demanded that they return the girl, and the Achaeans (Greeks) complied, indirectly causing the ''[[Achilles and Patroclus#In the Iliad|anger of Achilles]]'', which is the theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''.

[[File:John Flaxman - Apollo Preceding Hector with His Aegis, and Dispersing the Greeks, Fuseli's Lectures - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo preceding [[Hector]] with his [[aegis]], and dispersing the Greeks, by [[John Flaxman]]]]

Receiving the [[aegis]] from Zeus, Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father's command, causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry. He pushed the Greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers. He is described as &quot;the rouser of armies&quot; because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart.

When Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war, Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel. However, Apollo declined to fight him, saying that he would not fight his uncle for the sake of mortals.

[[File:Diomedes prevented by Apollo from pursuing Aeneas (?) MET 80355.jpg|thumb|Apollo preventing [[Diomedes]] from pursuing [[Aeneas]]]]

When the Greek hero [[Diomedes]] injured the Trojan hero [[Aeneas]], [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue him, but Diomedes injured her as well. Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him. He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain from attacking a god. Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos, a sacred spot in [[Troy]], where he was healed.

After the death of [[Sarpedon (Trojan War hero)|Sarpedon]], a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father's wish and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep ([[Hypnos]]) and Death ([[Thanatos]]). Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day, so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while.

[[File:Hector's body dragged at the Chariot of Achilles.jpg|thumb|Apollo protecting Hector's body, by [[John Flaxman]]]]

The Trojan hero [[Hector]] (who, according to some, was the god's own son by [[Hecuba]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stesichorus]], Fr. 108; [[Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron''  266; Porphyry in his ''Omissions'' states that [[Ibycus]], [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander]], [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]] and [[Lycophron]] all made Hector the son of Apollo.&lt;/ref&gt;) was favored by Apollo. When he got severely injured, Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms. During a duel with Achilles, when Hector was about to lose, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him. When the Greek warrior [[Patroclus]] tried to get into the fort of Troy, he was stopped by Apollo. Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus, Apollo stripped the armour of the Greek warrior and broke his weapons. Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector. At last, after Hector's fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles' attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse, shielding it from the rays of the [[Helios|sun]].

Apollo held a grudge against Achilles throughout the war because Achilles had murdered his son [[Tenes]] before the war began and brutally assassinated his son [[Troilus]] in his own temple. Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles, he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates. He foiled Achilles' attempt to mutilate Hector's dead body.

Finally, Apollo caused Achilles' death by guiding an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] into [[Achilles]]' heel. In some versions, Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris.

Apollo helped many Trojan warriors, including [[Agenor]], [[Polydamas (mythology)|Polydamas]], [[Glaucus]] in the battlefield. Though he greatly favored the Trojans, Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war.

===Nurturer of the young===

Apollo ''Kourotrophos'' is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young, especially boys. He oversees their education and their passage into adulthood. Education is said to have originated from Apollo and the [[Muses]]. Many myths have him train his children. It was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood.

[[Chiron]], the abandoned [[centaur]], was fostered by Apollo, who instructed him in medicine, prophecy, archery and more. Chiron would later become a great teacher himself.

[[Asclepius]] in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts from his father. However, he was later entrusted to Chiron for further education.

[[Anius]], Apollo's son by [[Rhoeo]], was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth. Apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts. Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos.

[[Iamus]] was the son of Apollo and [[Evadne]]. When Evadne went into labour, Apollo sent the [[Moirai]] to assist his lover. After the child was born, Apollo sent snakes to feed the child some honey. When Iamus reached the age of education, Apollo took him to Olympia and taught him many arts, including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Olympian Ode 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Idmon]] was educated by Apollo to be a seer. Even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the [[Argonauts]], he embraced his destiny and died a brave death. To commemorate his son's bravery, Apollo commanded Boeotians to build a town around the tomb of the hero, and to honor him.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius. Argonautica ii, 846 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo adopted [[Carnus]], the abandoned son of Zeus and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]]. He reared the child with the help of his mother Leto and educated him to be a seer.

When his son [[Melaneus of Oechalia|Melaneus]] reached the age of marriage, Apollo asked the princess [[Stratonice (mythology)|Stratonice]] to be his son's bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed.

Apollo saved a shepherd boy (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius.&lt;ref&gt;The Cyclopedia, Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature, Volume 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===God of music===

[[File:The music of the spheres.jpg|thumb|220px|The music of the spheres. Shown in this engraving from Renaissance Italy are Apollo, the Muses, the planetary spheres and musical ratios.]]
[[File:Apollo,_Hyacinthus_and_Cyparis_singing_and_playing_by_Alexander_Ivanov.jpg|left|thumb|Apollo, [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] and [[Cyparissus]] singing and playing, by [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]] 1831â€“1834]]
Immediately after his birth, Apollo demanded a lyre and invented the [[paean]], thus becoming the god of music. As the divine singer, he is the patron of poets, singers and musicians. The invention of string music is attributed to him. [[Plato]] said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music, rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Laws (Plato)|Laws]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166%3Abook%3D2%3Apage%3D653 653.4]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Socrates]], ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together, both for the gods and the humans. For this reason, he was called ''Homopolon'' before the ''Homo'' was replaced by ''A''.&lt;ref&gt;The prefix ''A'' means &quot;without&quot; or &quot;not&quot;, and ''polloi'' means &quot;many&quot;, thus ''Apollo'' means &quot;not many&quot; or &quot;united&quot;, referring to his ability to create harmony.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's harmonious music delivered people from their pain, and hence, like Dionysus, he is also called the liberator.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; The swans, which were considered to be the most musical among the birds, were believed to be the &quot;singers of Apollo&quot;. They are Apollo's sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to [[Hyperborea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] says that when the singers would sing hymns to Apollo, the swans would join the chant in unison.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the nature of Animals'' 11. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parnassus, Andrea Appiani (1811).jpg|thumb|270px|Apollo and the Muses on Parnassus, by [[Andrea Appiani]]|left]]

Among the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of Apollo, their principal deity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''[[Varia Historia]]'', 2. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes LaÃ«rtius]], 8.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Vit. Pyth.'' 8.91.141&lt;/ref&gt; Their belief was that music purifies the soul, just as medicine purifies the body. They also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos, evolving into an idea known as the [[music of the spheres]].&lt;ref&gt;Landels, John G (1999) ''Music in Ancient Greece and Rome''&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo appears as the companion of the [[Muses]], and as [[Musagetes]] (&quot;leader of Muses&quot;) he leads them in dance. They spend their time on [[Parnassus]], which is one of their sacred places. Apollo is also the lover of the Muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like [[Orpheus]] and [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]].

Apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the [[lyre]].&lt;ref&gt;Iliad (i. 603)&lt;/ref&gt; In his role as the god of banquets, he was always present to play music at weddings of the gods, like the marriage of [[Eros]] and [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. He is a frequent guest of the [[Bacchanalia]], and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the [[maenads]] and satyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Detienne, Marcel (2001) ''Forgetting Delphi between Apollo and Dionysus''&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others. He was the victor in all those contests, but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their [[hubris]].

====Apollo's lyre====

The invention of the lyre is attributed either to [[Hermes]] or to Apollo himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeric Hymn to Hermes (IV, 1â€“506)|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0138%3ahymn%3d4|website=Perseus|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell, whereas the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo's cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[Pylos]], covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made his [[lyre]].

[[File:NoÃ«l Coypel - Story of Apollo-Apollo and Mercury, 1688.jpg|thumb|180px|The friendship of Apollo and Hermes, by [[NoÃ«l Coypel]]]]

Upon discovering the theft, Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle. When Hermes acted innocent, Apollo took the matter to Zeus. Zeus, having seen the events, sided with Apollo, and ordered Hermes to return the cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA162 p. 162].&lt;/ref&gt; Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became the master of the lyre.

According to other versions, Apollo had invented the lyre himself, whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to [[Marsyas]]. Hermes' lyre, therefore, would be a reinvention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Norman O.|last=Brown|title=Hermes the Thief: The Evolution of a Myth|year=1947 |isbn=0-940262-26-6|location=Madison|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contest with Pan====

[[File:Laurits Regner Tuxen The-Musical-Dual-Of-Pan-And-Apollo.jpg|thumb|The musical duel of Pan and Apollo, by [[Laurits Tuxen]]]]

Once [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest. The mountain-god [[Tmolus (son of Ares)|Tmolus]] was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present. Then, Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone was pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a donkey.

====Contest with Marsyas====

[[Marsyas]] was a [[satyr]] who was punished by Apollo for his [[hubris]]. He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the [[Muse]]s, or the nymphs of [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]]. Athena was also present to witness the contest.

Marsyas taunted Apollo for &quot;wearing his hair long, for having a fair face and smooth body, for his skill in so many arts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Florida 3.2&quot;&gt;Apuleius, ''Florida'' 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; He also further said,

{{blockquote|'His [Apollo] hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face. His body is fair from head to foot, his limbs shine bright, his tongue gives oracles, and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse, propose which you will. What of his robes so fine in texture, so soft to the touch, aglow with purple? What of his lyre that flashes gold, gleams white with ivory, and shimmers with rainbow gems? What of his song, so cunning and so sweet? Nay, all these allurements suit with naught save luxury. To virtue they bring shame alone!'&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Florida 3.2&quot;/&gt;}}

The Muses and Athena sniggered at this comment. The contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could &quot;do whatever he wanted&quot; to the loser.

[[File:05apol1.jpg|thumb|260px|The contest between Apollo and [[Marsyas]], by [[Palma il Giovane]]|left]]

According to one account, after the first round, they both were deemed equal by the [[Nysiads]]. But in the next round, Apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating. But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was similar to singing, and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all. The nymphs decided that Apollo's argument was just. Apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this. Apollo was declared the winner and, angered with Marsyas' haughtiness and his accusations, decided to flay the satyr.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot;&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 75. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo - Charles AndrÃ© van Loo (1735).jpg|thumb|Marsyas flayed by the order of Apollo, by	[[Charles-AndrÃ© van Loo]]]]

According to another account, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack.&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus the Younger, Imagines 2 (trans. Fairbanks)&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument. So the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner. Apollo hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him.&lt;ref&gt;''Man Myth and Magic'' by Richard Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo [[flaying|flayed]] the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near [[Celaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#165 165].&lt;/ref&gt; and nailed Marsyas' flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree as a lesson to the others. Marsyas' blood turned into the river Marsyas. But Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done, he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away. The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo's sons [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]] and [[Orpheus]]. The Muses fixed the middle string, Linus the string struck with the forefinger, and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it. They took it back to Apollo, but the god, who had decided to stay away from music for a while, laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined [[Cybele]] in her wanderings to as far as [[Hyperborea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apostle Arne Horn, ''The Book of Eusebius'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contest with Cinyras====

Cinyras was a ruler of [[Cyprus]], who was a friend of [[Agamemnon]]. Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war, but did not keep his promise. Agamemnon cursed Cinyras. He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise. Apollo then had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], and defeated him. Either Cinyras committed suicide when he lost, or was killed by Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D1 11.20&amp;ndash;23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on Iliad; cf. also scholia on the same passage&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollon Raon Versailles MV5921.jpg|thumb|Apollon Raon, [[Versailles]]]]

===Patron of sailors===
Apollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors, one of the duties he shares with [[Poseidon]]. In the myths, he is seen helping heroes who pray to him for a safe journey.

When Apollo spotted a ship of Cretan sailors that were caught in a storm, he quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Hymn to Pythian Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Argonauts]] faced a terrible storm, [[Jason]] prayed to his patron, Apollo, to help them. Apollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light upon an island, where the Argonauts soon took shelter. This island was renamed &quot;[[Anafi|Anaphe]]&quot;, which means &quot;He revealed it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius of Rhodes, ''Argonautica''&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo helped the Greek hero [[Diomedes]], to escape from a great tempest during his journey homeward. As a token of gratitude, Diomedes built a temple in honor of Apollo under the epithet Epibaterius (&quot;the embarker&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;John Potter, ''Archaeologia Graeca: Or, The Antiquities of Greece, Volume 1''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Trojan War, [[Odysseus]] came to the Trojan camp to return Chriseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]], and brought many offerings to Apollo. Pleased with this, Apollo sent gentle breezes that helped Odysseus return safely to the Greek camp.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''the Ilaid'' 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arion]] was a poet who was kidnapped by some sailors for the rich prizes he possessed. Arion requested them to let him sing for the last time, to which the sailors consented. Arion began singing a song in praise of Apollo, seeking the god's help. Consequently, numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when Arion jumped into the water, the dolphins carried him away safely.

===Wars===

====Trojan War====
Apollo played a pivotal role in the entire Trojan War. He sided with the Trojans, and sent a terrible plague to the Greek camp, which indirectly led to the conflict between [[Achilles]] and [[Agamemnon]]. He killed the Greek heroes [[Patroclus]], Achilles, and numerous Greek soldiers. He also helped many Trojan heroes, the most important one being [[Hector]]. After the end of the war, Apollo and Poseidon together cleaned the remains of the city and the camps.

====Telegony war====
A war broke out between the [[Brygoi]] and the Thesprotians, who had the support of [[Odysseus]]. The gods Athena and [[Ares]] came to the battlefield and took sides. Athena helped the hero Odysseus while Ares fought alongside of the Brygoi. When Odysseus lost, Athena and Ares came into a direct duel. To stop the battling gods and the terror created by their battle, Apollo intervened and stopped the duel between them.&lt;ref&gt;Eugammon of Cyrene, ''Telegony Fragment''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Sammons, ''Device and Composition in the Greek Epic Cycle''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian war====
When Zeus suggested that [[Dionysus]] defeat the Indians in order to earn a place among the gods, Dionysus declared war against the Indians and travelled to India along with his army of [[Bacchantes]] and [[satyrs]]. Among the warriors was [[Aristaeus]], Apollo's son. Apollo armed his son with his own hands and gave him a bow and arrows and fitted a strong shield to his arm.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 13&lt;/ref&gt; After Zeus urged Apollo to join the war, he went to the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 27&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing several of his [[nymphs]] and Aristaeus drowning in a river, he took them to safety and healed them.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 24&lt;/ref&gt; He taught Aristaeus more useful healing arts and sent him back to help the army of Dionysus.

====Theban war====
During the war between the sons of [[Oedipus]], Apollo favored [[Amphiaraus]], a seer and one of the leaders in the war. Though saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war, Apollo made Amphiaraus' last hours glorious by &quot;lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam&quot;. When [[Hypseus]] tried to kill the hero with a spear, Apollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of Amphiaraus instead. Then Apollo himself replaced the charioteer and took the reins in his hands. He deflected many spears and arrows away from them. He also killed many of the enemy warriors like [[Melaneus (mythology)|Melaneus]], [[Antiphus]], Aetion, Polites and [[Lampus]]. At last, when the moment of departure came, Apollo expressed his grief with tears in his eyes and bid farewell to Amphiaraus, who was soon engulfed by the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Thebaid'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slaying of giants===

Apollo killed the giants Python and Tityos, who had assaulted his mother Leto.

====Gigantomachy====
During the [[gigantomachy]], Apollo and [[Heracles]] blinded the giant [[Ephialtes (disambiguation)|Ephialtes]] by shooting him in his eyes, Apollo shooting his left and Heracles his right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D6%3Asection%3D2 1.6.2].&lt;/ref&gt; He also killed [[Porphyrion]], the king of giants, using his bow and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Pythian'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DP.%3Apoem%3D8 8.12â€“18].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aloadae====
The [[Aloadae]], namely Otis and Ephialtes, were twin giants who decided to wage war upon the gods. They attempted to storm Mt. Olympus by piling up mountains, and threatened to fill the sea with mountains and inundate dry land.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, s.v. Aloadae, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; They even dared to seek the hand of Hera and Artemis in marriage. Angered by this, Apollo killed them by shooting them with arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D271 11.305].&lt;/ref&gt; According to another tale, Apollo killed them by sending a deer between them; as they tried to kill it with their javelins, they accidentally stabbed each other and died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#28 28].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phorbas====
[[Phorbas]] was a savage giant king of [[Phlegyas (Boeotia)|Phlegyas]] who was described as having swine-like features. He wished to plunder Delphi for its wealth. He seized the roads to Delphi and started harassing the pilgrims. He captured the old people and children and sent them to his army to hold them for ransom. And he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing, only to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him. He hung the chopped-off heads to an oak tree. Finally, Apollo came to put an end to this cruelty. He entered a boxing contest with Phorbas and killed him with a single blow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus the Elder]], ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'' [https://archive.org/details/imagines00philuoft/page/214/mode/2up?view=theater 2.19].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other stories===

[[File:FranÃ§ois Boucher - The Rising of the Sun - WGA02916.jpg|thumb|Apollo as the rising sun, by [[FranÃ§ois Boucher]]]]

In the first [[Olympic games]], Apollo defeated [[Ares]] and became the victor in wrestling. He outran [[Hermes]] in the race and won first place.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Histories 5. 7. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo divides months into summer and winter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Orphic Hymn]]'' 34 ''to Apollon'', 21 (Athanassakis and Wolkow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTo3r8IHy0wC&amp;pg=PA30 pp. 30&amp;ndash;31]).&lt;/ref&gt; He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the [[Hyperborea]]ns during the winter months, and the absence of warmth in winter is due to his departure. During his absence, Delphi was under the care of [[Dionysus]], and no prophecies were given during winters.

==== Periphas ====

[[Periphas]] was an Attican king and a priest of Apollo. He was noble, just and rich. He did all his duties justly. Because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as Zeus. At one point, they worshipped Periphas in place of Zeus and set up shrines and temples for him. This annoyed Zeus, who decided to annihilate the entire family of Periphas. But because he was a just king and a good devotee, Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas. Zeus considered Apollo's words and agreed to let him live. But he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds. When Periphas' wife requested Zeus to let her stay with her husband, Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'' [https://topostext.org/work/216#6 6]; Grimal, s.v. Periphas (2), p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Molpadia and Parthenos ====

Molpadia and Parthenos were the sisters of [[Rhoeo]], a former lover of Apollo. One day, they were put in charge of watching their father's ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty. While they were asleep, the wine jar was broken by the swine their family kept. When the sisters woke up and saw what had happened, they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their father's wrath. Apollo, who was passing by, caught them and carried them to two different cities in Chersonesus, Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus. He turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors. Molpadia's name was changed to [[Hemithea (mythology)|Hemithea]] upon her deification.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 5. 62. 3â€“4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prometheus ====

[[Prometheus]] was the titan who was punished by Zeus for stealing fire. He was bound to a rock, where each day an eagle was sent to eat Prometheus' liver, which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day. Seeing his plight, Apollo pleaded with Zeus to release the kind Titan, while Artemis and Leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes. Zeus, moved by Apollo's words and the tears of the goddesses, finally sent Heracles to free Prometheus.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Flaccus, ''Argonautica'' 4. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicolas-Guy Brenet - Apollo Crowning the Arts, 1771.jpg|thumb|Apollo crowning the arts, by [[Nicolas-Guy Brenet]]]]

==== Heracles ====

After [[Heracles]] (then named Alcides) was struck with madness and killed his family, he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo. Apollo, through the Pythia, commanded him to serve king [[Eurystheus]] for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him. Only then would Alcides be absolved of his sin. Apollo also renamed him Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D12 2.4.12].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corinthian helmet Cdm Paris BB2013 n2.jpg|thumb|right|Heracles and Apollo struggling over the hind, as depicted on a Corinthian helmet (early 5th century BC)]]

To complete his third task, Heracles had to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], a hind sacred to Artemis, and bring back it alive. After chasing the hind for one year, the animal eventually got tired, and when it tried crossing the river Ladon, Heracles captured it. While he was taking it back, he was confronted by Apollo and Artemis, who were angered at Heracles for this act. However, Heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her. After much pleading, Artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D3 2.5.3].&lt;/ref&gt;

After he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus, Heracles fell in conflict with Iphytus, a prince of Oechalia, and murdered him. Soon after, he contracted a terrible disease. He consulted the oracle of Apollo once again, in the hope of ridding himself of the disease. The Pythia, however, denied to give any prophesy. In anger, Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away, intending to start his own oracle. However, Apollo did not tolerate this and stopped Heracles; a duel ensued between them. Artemis rushed to support Apollo, while Athena supported Heracles. Soon, Zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them. He reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation and asked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles. Apollo then ordered the hero to serve under [[Omphale]], queen of [[Lydia]] for one year in order to purify himself.

After their reconciliation, Apollo and Heracles together founded the city of Gythion.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 3. 21. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plato's concept of soulmates ====

A long time ago, there were three kinds of human beings: male, descended from the sun; female, descended from the earth; and androgynous, descended from the moon. Each human being was completely round, with four arms and four legs, two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears, and all else to match. They were powerful and unruly. [[Aloadae|Otis]] and [[Aloadae|Ephialtes]] even dared to scale [[Mount Olympus]].

To check their insolence, Zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them. He cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary repairs, giving humans the individual shape they still have now. Apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds, he pulled together their skin at the [[abdomen]], and sewed the skin together at the middle of it. This is what we call [[navel]] today. He smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest. But he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[The Symposium]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|&quot;As he [Zeus] cut them one after another, he bade Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn... Apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms. So Apollo gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly, like the purses which draw in, and he made one mouth at the centre [of the belly] which he fastened in a knot (the same which is called the navel); he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles, much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last; he left a few wrinkles, however, in the region of the belly and navel, as a memorial of the primeval state.}}

==== The rock of Leukas ====

Leukatas was believed to be a white-colored rock jutting out from the island of [[Lefkada|Leukas]] into the sea. It was present in the sanctuary of Apollo Leukates. A leap from this rock was believed to have put an end to the longings of love.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo, Geography 10. 2. 8&quot;&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D8 10.2.8].&lt;/ref&gt;

Once, Aphrodite fell deeply in love with [[Adonis]], a young man of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar. Heartbroken, Aphrodite wandered looking for the rock of Leukas. When she reached the sanctuary of Apollo in Argos, she confided in him her love and sorrow. Apollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock. She did so and was freed from her love. When she sought the reason behind this, Apollo told her that Zeus, before taking another lover, would sit on this rock to free himself from his love for Hera.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceE&quot;&gt;Ptolemy Hephaestion, ''New History Book'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tale relates that a man named Nireus, who fell in love with the cult statue of Athena, came to the rock and jumped in order to relieve himself. After jumping, he fell into the net of a fisherman in which, when he was pulled out, he found a box filled with gold. He fought with the fisherman and took the gold, but Apollo appeared to him in the night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceE&quot;/&gt;

It was an ancestral custom among the Leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every year at the sacrifice performed in honor of Apollo for the sake of averting evil. However, a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the criminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''On Animals'' 11. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceE&quot;/&gt; This was the same rock from which, according to a legend, Sappho took her suicidal leap.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo, Geography 10. 2. 8&quot;/&gt;

==== Slaying of Titans ====
Once [[Hera]], out of spite, aroused the Titans to war against [[Zeus]] and take away his throne. Accordingly, when the Titans tried to climb [[Mount Olympus]], Zeus with the help of Apollo, [[Artemis]] and [[Athena]], defeated them and cast them into Tartarus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#150 150].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female lovers===

[[File:Robert Sanderson - Apollo and the Muses.jpg|thumb|Apollo and the Muses, by Robert Sanderson]]
Apollo is said to have been the lover of all nine [[Muses]], and not being able to choose one of them, he decided to remain unwed. He fathered the [[Corybantes]] by the Muse [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D3%3Asection%3D4 1.3.4].&lt;/ref&gt; By [[Calliope]], he had [[Hymenaios]], [[Ialemus]], [[Orpheus]]&lt;ref&gt;Asclepiades, Tragoidoumena 6 (from Scholia ad Pindari Pythia 4.313a)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Linus (Thracian)|Linus]]. Alternatively, Linus was said to be the son of Apollo and either [[Urania]] or [[Terpsichore]].

In the Great Eoiae that is attributed to Hesoid, Scylla is the daughter of Apollo and Hecate.&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. iv. 828&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]] was a Thessalian princess whom Apollo loved. In her honor, he built the city Cyrene and made her its ruler. She was later granted longevity by Apollo who turned her into a nymph. The couple had two sons, [[Aristaeus]], and [[Idmon]].

[[Evadne]] was a nymph daughter of Poseidon and a lover of Apollo. They had a son, [[Iamos]]. During the time of the childbirth, Apollo sent [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth to assist her.

[[Rhoeo]], a princess of the island of Naxos was loved by Apollo. Out of affection for her, Apollo turned her sisters into goddesses. On the island Delos she bore Apollo a son named [[Anius]]. Not wanting to have the child, she entrusted the infant to Apollo and left. Apollo raised and educated the child on his own.

Ourea, a daughter of [[Poseidon]], fell in love with Apollo when he and Poseidon were serving the Trojan king [[Laomedon]]. They both united on the day the walls of [[Troy]] were built. She bore to Apollo a son, whom Apollo named Ileus, after the city of his birth, Ilion ([[Troy]]). Ileus was very dear to Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Tzetzes]]' ''Exegesis in Iliadem'' 1.126 [= Hesiod ''Catalogue of Women'' fr. 83].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thero (mythology)|Thero]], daughter of [[Phylas]], a maiden as beautiful as the moonbeams, was loved by the radiant Apollo, and she loved him in return. Through their union, she became the mother of Chaeron, who was famed as &quot;the tamer of horses&quot;. He later built the city [[Chaeronea]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyrie or Thyrie was the mother of [[Cycnus (son of Apollo)|Cycnus]]. Apollo turned both the mother and son into swans when they jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'' [https://topostext.org/work/216#12 12]; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0074%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D350 7.350]; Smith 1873, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D40%3Aentry%3Dcycnus-bio-1 s.v. Cycnus (1)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hecuba]] was the wife of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]], and Apollo had a son with her named [[Troilus]]. An [[oracle]] prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by [[Achilleus]], and Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles. After the sack of Troy, Hecuba was taken to Lycia by Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stesichorus]], Fr.108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coronis (lover of Apollo)|Coronis]] was daughter of [[Phlegyas]], King of the [[Lapiths]]. While pregnant with [[Asclepius]], Coronis fell in love with [[Ischys]], son of [[Elatus]] and slept with him. When Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers or thanks to his [[Lycius (son of Clinis)|raven]] who informed him, he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. Apollo rescued the baby by cutting open Coronis' belly and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] to raise.

[[Dryope (daughter of Dryops)|Dryope]], the daughter of Dryops, was impregnated by Apollo in the form of a snake. She gave birth to a son named Amphissus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses,'' [https://topostext.org/work/216#32 32]; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0074%3Abook%3D9%3Acard%3D324 9.330].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'', Apollo fathered [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] by [[Creusa (daughter of Erechtheus)|Creusa]], wife of [[Xuthus]]. He used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father. Later, when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, Apollo asked [[Hermes]] to save the child and bring him to the oracle at [[Delphi]], where he was raised by a priestess.

Apollo loved and kidnapped an Oceanid nymph, [[Melia (consort of Apollo)|Melia]]. Her father [[Oceanus]] sent one of his sons, [[Caanthus]], to find her, but Caanthus could not take her back from Apollo, so he burned Apollo's sanctuary. In retaliation, Apollo shot and killed Caanthus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.10.5 9.10.5&amp;ndash;6].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male lovers===
[[File:Cesio, Carlo 1626 - 1686) - Apollo e Giacinto, inc. da Annibale Carracci, -1675-.jpg|thumb|''Apollo and Hyacinthus'', by [[Carlo Cesio]]]]
[[File:Kiselev Death of Hyacinth.jpg|thumb|left|Death of Hyacinth, by [[Alexander Kiselyov (painter)|Alexander Kiselyov]], 1850â€“1900]]

Hyacinth (or Hyacinthus), a beautiful and athletic [[Sparta]]n prince, was one of Apollo's favourite lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D143 10.143 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; The pair was practicing throwing the [[Discus throw|discus]] when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous [[Zephyrus]] and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief. Out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a [[hyacinth (plant)|flower]] named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection {{lang|grc|Î±á¼°Î±á¿–}}, meaning ''alas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ai)ai{{=}}|Î±á¼°Î±á¿–}}, {{LSJ|ai)/2|Î±á¼´|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was later resurrected and taken to heaven. The festival [[Hyacinthia]] was a national celebration of Sparta, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1890, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:entry=hyacinthia-cn&amp;highlight=hyacinthus s.v. Hyacinthia].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another male lover was [[Cyparissus]], a descendant of [[Heracles]]. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a [[Pilum|javelin]] as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the [[Cupressaceae|Cypress]] named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0074%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D86 10.106â€“10.142]; Tripp, s.v. Cyparissus.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Granger-Apollo.jpg|thumb|200px|Apollo and [[Cyparissus]], by [[Jean-Pierre Granger]] (1779â€“1840)]]

[[Admetus]], the king of Pherae, was also Apollo's lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Callimachus]], Hymn to Apollo, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Numa&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0052%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D5 4.5].&lt;/ref&gt; During his exile, which lasted either for one year or nine years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keaveney|first=Arthur|date=1 January 1984|journal=Philologus|volume=128|issue=1â€“2|doi=10.1524/phil.1984.128.12.138|issn=2196-7008|title=A Note on Servius, Ad ''Aeneid'' 7, 637|pages=138â€“139|s2cid=164720549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman. The romantic nature of their relationship was first described by [[Callimachus]] of Alexandria, who wrote that Apollo was &quot;fired with love&quot; for Admetus.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Plutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo's lovers and says that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Amatorius'' 17&lt;/ref&gt; Latin poet [[Ovid]] in his {{lang|la|[[Ars Amatoria]]}} said that even though he was a god, Apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' 2.239&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibullus]] describes Apollo's love to the king as ''servitium amoris'' (slavery of love) and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice. He would also make cheese and serve it to Admetus. His domestic actions caused embarrassment to his family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tibullus]], ''Elegies'' 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicolas-Antoine Taunay - Apolo visitando Admeto.jpg|thumb|250px|Apollo visiting Admetus, by [[Nicolas-Antoine Taunay]], 19th century]]

{{blockquote| Oh how often his sister (Diana) blushed at meeting her brother as he carried a young calf through the fields!....often Latona lamented when she saw her son's disheveled locks which were admired even by Juno, his step-mother...&lt;ref&gt;Tibullus, ''Elegies'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When Admetus wanted to marry princess [[Alcestis]], Apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed. This satisfied Alcestis' father and he let Admetus marry his daughter. Further, Apollo saved the king from Artemis' wrath and also convinced the [[Moirai]] to postpone Admetus' death once.

[[Branchus (lover of Apollo)|Branchus]], a shepherd, one day came across Apollo in the woods. Captivated by the god's beauty, he kissed Apollo. Apollo requited his affections and wanting to reward him, bestowed prophetic skills on him. His descendants, the Branchides, were an influential clan of prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Pepin, Ronald E. (2008). The Vatican Mythographers. Fordham Univ Press. {{ISBN|9780823228928}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other male lovers of Apollo include:

*[[Adonis]], who is said to have been the lover of both Apollo and Aphrodite. He behaved as a man with Aphrodite and as a woman with Apollo.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Ptolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 4 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Atymnius]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', 11. 258; 19. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known as a beloved of [[Sarpedon (brother of Minos)|Sarpedon]]

*[[Cinyras]], king of Cyprus and the priest of Aphrodite&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Pythian Ode'' 2 lines 15â€“17 with [[scholia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Helenus]], a Trojan prince (son of [[Priam]] and [[Hecuba]]). He received from Apollo an ivory bow with which he later wounded Achilles in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;Photius, 'Bibliotheca excerpts'&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hippolytus of [[Sicyon]] (not the same as [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus, the son of Theseus]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Numa&quot; /&gt;

[[Hyginus]], ''[[De Astronomica]]'', [https://topostext.org/work/207#2.14.5 2.14].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===

Apollo sired many children, from mortal women and nymphs as well as the goddesses. His children grew up to be physicians, musicians, poets, seers or archers. Many of his sons founded new cities and became kings.

[[File:1590. Apollo Entrusting Chiron with the Education of Aescalapius - etching - Washington DC, NGA.jpg|thumb|Apollo entrusting [[Chiron]] with the education of Aescalapius]]

[[Asclepius]] is the most famous son of Apollo. His skills as a physician surpassed that of Apollo's. Zeus killed him for bringing back the dead, but upon Apollo's request, he was resurrected as a god. 
[[Aristaeus]] was placed under the care of Chiron after his birth. He became the god of beekeeping, cheese-making, animal husbandry and more. He was ultimately given immortality for the benefits he bestowed upon humanity. The [[Corybantes]] were spear-clashing, dancing demigods.

The sons of Apollo who participated in the Trojan War include the Trojan princes [[Hector]] and [[Troilus]], as well as [[Tenes]], the king of [[Tenedos]], all three of whom were killed by Achilles over the course of the war.

Apollo's children who became musicians and bards include [[Orpheus]], [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]], [[Ialemus]], [[Hymen (god)|Hymen]]aeus, [[Philammon]], [[Eumolpus]] and [[Eleuther]]. Apollo fathered 3 daughters, [[Apollonis]], [[Borysthenis]] and [[Cephisso]], who formed a group of minor Muses, the &quot;Musa Apollonides&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eumelus, Fragment 35 (from Tzetzes, On Hesiod's Works &amp; Days 23)&lt;/ref&gt; They were nicknamed Nete, Mese and Hypate after the highest, middle and lowest strings of his lyre.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} [[Phemonoe]] was a seer and poet who was the inventor of Hexameter.

[[Apis (Greek mythology)|Apis]], [[Idmon]], [[Iamus]], [[Tenerus (son of Apollo)|Tenerus]], [[Mopsus]], [[Themisto (disambiguation)|Galeus]], Telmessus and others were gifted seers. [[Anius]], Pythaeus and [[Ismenus]] lived as high priests. Most of them were trained by Apollo himself.

[[Arabius (mythology)|Arabus]], [[Delphos (mythology)|Delphos]], [[Dryops (mythology)|Dryops]], [[Miletos]], [[Tenes]], [[Epidaurus (mythology)|Epidaurus]], Ceos, [[Lycorus|Lycoras]], [[Syrus]], Pisus, Marathus, Megarus, Patarus, [[Acraepheus]], Cicon, Chaeron and many other sons of Apollo, under the guidance of his words, founded eponymous cities.

He also had a son by Agathippe who was named Chrysorrhoas who was a mechanic artist.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Of the Names of Rivers and Mountains, and Of Such Things as are to be Found Therein''&lt;/ref&gt; His other daughters include [[Eurynome]], [[Chariclo]] wife of [[Chiron]], [[Eurydice]] the wife of Orpheus, [[Eriopis]], famous for her beautiful hair, [[Melite (heroine)|Melite]] the heroine, [[Pamphile]] the silk weaver, Parthenos, and by some accounts, Phoebe, Hilyra and [[Scylla]]. Apollo turned Parthenos into a constellation after her early death.

Additionally, Apollo fostered and educated [[Chiron]], the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods, including Apollo's sons. Apollo also fostered [[Carnus]], the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]].

The relevant passage in Stephanus in fact reads: &quot;Acraephia... was founded either by Athamas or by Acraepheus, son of Apollo. The mountain is named after Ptous, son of the aforesaid individual (Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Î±á½Ï„Î¿á¿¦) and Euxippe&quot;. The version given in scholia on Pausanias has prompted several scholars to emend &quot;Euxippe&quot; to &quot;Zeuxippe&quot;, and to assume that &quot;Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Î±á½Ï„Î¿á¿¦&quot; refers to Apollo rather than Acraepheus. Such an interpretation, however, has been contested on the strength of the facts that Stephanus must have closely followed Herodianus, where the parents' names are unambiguously Acraepheus and Euxippe, and that the passage in scholia on Pausanias allows for an alternate understanding that doesn't necessarily make Apollo and Zeuxippe parents of Ptous.

===Failed love attempts===

Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The love-stories themselves were not told until later.&quot; [[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'' 1951:140.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.

{{Main|Apollo and Daphne}}

[[File:Apollo and Daphne (Bernini).jpg|thumb|340x340px|''[[Apollo and Daphne]]'' by [[Bernini]] in the [[Galleria Borghese]]|left]]
[[Daphne]] was a [[nymph]] who scorned Apollo's advances and ran away from him. When Apollo chased her in order to persuade her, she changed herself into a laurel tree. According to other versions, she cried for help during the chase, and [[Gaia]] helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#203 203].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roman poet [[Ovid]], the chase was brought about by [[Cupid]], who hit Apollo with a golden arrow of love and Daphne with a leaden arrow of hatred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0074%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D452 1.452â€“567]; Tripp, s.v. Daphne.&lt;/ref&gt; The myth explains the origin of the [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] and the connection of Apollo with the laurel and its leaves, which his priestess employed at [[Delphi]]. The leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the [[Pythian games]].

[[Marpessa (daughter of Evenus)|Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well. [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D8 1.7.8&amp;ndash;9]; cf. [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D9%3Acard%3D538 9.557&amp;ndash;560].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sinope (mythology)|Sinope]], a nymph, was approached by the amorous Apollo. She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for, and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin. Apollo kept his promise and went back.

[[Bolina]] was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph, saving her life.

[[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the [[castalian Spring|spring]] at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statius]], ''[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]'' 1.696 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cassandra]], was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam. Apollo wished to court her. Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition â€“ he should give her the power to see the future. Apollo fulfilled her wish, but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after. Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.

The [[Cumaean Sibyl|Sibyl of Cumae]] like Cassandra promised Apollo her love if he would give her a boon. The Sibyl took a handful of sand and asked Apollo to grant her years of life as many as the grains of sand she held in her hands. Apollo granted her wish, but Sibyl went back on her word. Although Sibyl did live an extended life as Apollo had promised, he did not give her agelessness along with it, so she shrivelled and shrank and only her voice remained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 14.129â€“154&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hestia]], the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo's and Poseidon's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried.

In one version of the prophet [[Tiresias]]'s origins, he was originally a woman who promised Apollo to sleep with him if he would give her music lessons. Apollo gave her her wish, but then she went back on her word and refused him. Apollo in anger turned her into a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Domitilla | last1 = Campanile | first2 = Filippo | last2 = CarlÃ -Uhink | first3 = Margherita | last3 = Facella | page =[https://books.google.com/books?id=39ENDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT57 57] | title = TransAntiquity: Cross-Dressing and Transgender Dynamics in the Ancient World | publisher = [[Routledge]] | date = 23 February 2017 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=39ENDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 9781138941205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female counterparts===

[[File:Gavin Hamilton - Apollo and Artemis, 1770.jpg|thumb|200px|Apollo and Artemis, by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]]|left]]

====Artemis====

[[File:Apollo Artemis Brygos Louvre G151.jpg|thumb|220px|Apollo (left) and [[Artemis]], by [[Brygos]] (potter signed). Tondo of an Attic red-figure cup {{circa|470 BC}}, [[MusÃ©e du Louvre]].]]

Artemis as the sister of Apollo, is ''thea apollousa'', that is, she as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity. In the pre-Hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} However, this relationship was never sexual but spiritual,&lt;ref&gt;Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1197&lt;/ref&gt; which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the [[Hellenic period]].{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

Artemis, like her brother, is armed with a bow and arrows. She is the cause of sudden deaths of women. She also is the protector of the young, especially girls. Though she has nothing to do with oracles, music or poetry, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lNV6-HsUppsC&amp;pg=PA268 s.v. Artemis, p. 268]&lt;/ref&gt; The laurel (''[[daphne]]'') was sacred to both. ''Artemis Daphnaia'' had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shipley, &quot;The Extent of Spartan Territory in the Late Classical and Hellenistic Periods&quot;, ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Apollo Daphnephoros'' had a temple in [[Eretria]], a &quot;place where the citizens are to take the oaths&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rufus B. Richardson, &quot;A Temple in Eretria&quot; ''The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts'', '''10'''.3 (July â€“ September 1895:326â€“337); Paul Auberson, ''Eretria. Fouilles et Recherches I, Temple d'Apollon DaphnÃ©phoros, Architecture'' (Bern, 1968). See also [[Plutarch]], ''Pythian Oracle'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or [[Helios]], Artemis was naturally regarded as [[Selene]] or the moon.

====Hecate====

[[File:Jusepe de Ribera - Hecate, Procession to a Witches' Sabbath.jpg|thumb|Hecate: procession to  witches' sabbath, by [[Jusepe de Ribera]]]]

[[Hecate]], the goddess of witchcraft and magic, is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo. They both are cousins, since their mothers â€“ [[Leto]] and [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]] â€“ are sisters. One of Apollo's epithets, ''Hecatos'', is the masculine form of Hecate, and both names mean &quot;working from afar&quot;. While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven, Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} If Hecate is the &quot;gate-keeper&quot;, Apollo ''Agyieus'' is the &quot;door-keeper&quot;. Hecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo is the god and protector of streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Carol M. Mooney, B.A., ''Hekate: Her Role And Character In Greek Literature From Before The Fifth Century B.C.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Houbraken, Arnold - Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus - 1703.jpeg|thumb|left|Pallas Athena visiting Apollo on Parnassus, by [[Arnold Houbraken]]]]

The oldest evidence found for Hecate's worship is at Apollo's temple in Miletos. There, Hecate was taken to be Apollo's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Hecate's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements, at the same time, Apollo's solar nature.

====Athena====

As a deity of knowledge and great power, Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of [[Athena]]. Being Zeus' favorite children, they were given more powers and duties. Apollo and Athena often took up the role of protectors of cities, and were patrons of some of the important cities. Athena was the principal goddess of [[Athens]], Apollo was the principal god of [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://publicism.info/culture/apollo/7.html | title=APOLLO, THE YOUNG, AND THE CITY â€“ KEY THEMES â€“ Apollo â€“ Fritz Graf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As patrons of arts, Apollo and Athena were companions of the [[Muses]], the former a much more frequent companion than the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dawkins, ''The Shakespeare Enigma''&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo was sometimes called the son of Athena and Hephaestus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' [https://archive.org/details/denaturadeorumac00ciceuoft/page/338/mode/2up?view=theater&amp;q=Apollo 3.22].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Trojan War, as Zeus' executive, Apollo is seen holding the [[aegis]] like Athena usually does.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D15%3Acard%3D281 15.308].&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena, and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;1.Homer, ''Iliad'', Euripides, ''Ion'', Aeschylus, ''Oresteia''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollo in the ''Oresteia''===
[[File:Over life-size statue of Apollo Citharoedus (the lyre-player), from the Gymnasium of Salamis, 2nd century AD, Cyprus Museum, Nicosia, Cyprus (22484277762).jpg|thumb|Statue of Apollo Cithaeroedus, [[Cyprus Museum]], [[Nicosia]]]]

In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy, [[Clytemnestra]] kills her husband, King [[Agamemnon]] because he had sacrificed their daughter [[Iphigenia]] to proceed forward with the Trojan war. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], is to kill Clytemnestra and [[Aegisthus]], her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the [[Erinyes]] or Furies (female personifications of [[revenge|vengeance]]).

Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the [[matricide]] was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he drives them away. He says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's [[Supplication|supplicant]]. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo.

===Roman Apollo===

The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}} As a quintessentially [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]], Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as '''Phoebus'''.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}} There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the [[Roman Kingdom|kings of Rome]] during the reign of [[Tarquinius Superbus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Liv.+1.56 1.56].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's [[Temple of Apollo Sosianus|first temple]] at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the &quot;Apollinare&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=3:chapter=63 3.63.7], [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0145:book=4:chapter=25 4.25.3].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Punic War]] in 212 BCE, the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' (&quot;Apollonian Games&quot;) were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0147:book=25:chapter=12 25.12].&lt;/ref&gt; In the time of [[Augustus]], who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J.

After the [[Battle of Actium]], which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted [[quinquennial]] games in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars#Life of Augustus|Augustus]]'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#18.2 18.2]; [[Cassius Dio]] [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#1 51.1.1â€“3].&lt;/ref&gt; He also erected [[Temple of Apollo (Palatine)|a new temple]] to the god on the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#1.3 53.1.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] formed the culmination of the [[Secular Games]], held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 5050, translated by {{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Mary |author-link=Mary Beard (classicist) |last2=North |first2=John |last3=Price |first3=Simon |title=Religions of Rome: Volume 2: A Sourcebook |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-45015-7|page=5.7b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
The chief Apollonian festival was the [[Pythian Games]] held every four years at Delphi and was one of the four great [[Panhellenic Games]]. Also of major importance was the [[Delia (festival)|Delia]] held every four years on Delos.
Athenian annual festivals included the [[Boedromia]], [[Metageitnia]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1890, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DM%3Aentry+group%3D2%3Aentry%3Dmetageitnia-cn s.v. MACELLUM, MATRA'LIA, METAGEI'TNIA].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyanepsia]], and [[Thargelia]].
Spartan annual festivals were the [[Carneia]] and the [[Hyacinthia]].
[[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] every nine years held the [[Daphnephoria]].

==Attributes and symbols==

Apollo's most common attributes were the bow and [[arrow]]. Other attributes of his included the [[kithara]] (an advanced version of the common [[lyre]]), the [[plectrum]] and the sword. Another common emblem was the [[sacrificial tripod]], representing his prophetic powers. The [[Pythian Games]] were held in Apollo's honor every four years at [[Delphi]]. The [[bay laurel]] plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the [[laurel wreath|crown of victory]] at these games.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

The [[palm tree]] was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in [[Delos]]. Animals sacred to Apollo included [[wolf|wolves]], dolphins, [[roe deer]], [[swan]]s, [[cicada]]s (symbolizing music and song), [[raven]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[Corvus (genus)|crow]]s (Apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers),&lt;ref name=&quot;Porphyry&quot;/&gt; snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and [[griffin]]s, mythical eagleâ€“lion hybrids of Eastern origin.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

[[File:Apolocitaredo8.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Apollo Citharoedus]]'' (&quot;Apollo with a kithara&quot;), [[Musei Capitolini]], Rome]]

As god of colonization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shachar |first=Ilan |date=2 June 2008 |title=Greek colonization and the eponymous apollo |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09518960008569776 |journal=[[Mediterranean Historical Review]] |volume=15 |issue=2|pages=1â€“26 |doi=10.1080/09518960008569776 |s2cid=162333182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750â€“550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped [[Crete|Cretan]] or [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]]n colonists found the city of [[Troy]]. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention an Asia Minor god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of [[Wilusa]] attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Ilion]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as &quot;born in Lycia&quot;, which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]).

In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reasonâ€”characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for [[Hyperborea]], he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the [[Borghese Vase]].

Apollo is often associated with the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|Golden Mean]]. This is the Greek [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[moderation]] and a [[virtue]] that opposes [[gluttony]].

In antiquity, Apollo was associated with the planet Mercury. The ancient Greeks believed that Mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening, because each twilight Mercury would appear farther from the Sun as it set than it had the night before. The morning planet was called Apollo, and the one at evening Hermes/Mercury before they realised they were the same, thereupon the name 'Mercury/Hermes' was kept, and 'Apollo' was dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;:merc&quot;/&gt;

== Apollo in the arts ==
[[File:ÎšÎ¯Î¿Î½Î±Ï‚ Î‘Ï€ÏŒÎ»Î»Ï‰Î½Î± - Apolo en la columna - Apollo in the column.jpg|thumb|Statue of Apollo at the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]]]]

Apollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the [[Renaissance]]. The earliest Greek word for a statue is &quot;delight&quot; ({{lang|grc|á¼„Î³Î±Î»Î¼Î±}}, ''agalma''), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. [[Maurice Bowra]] notices that the Greek artist puts into a god the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra, ''The Greek Experience'', pp. 148, 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body which was essentially a religious activity.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra, ''The Greek Experience'', pp. 148, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra, ''The Greek Experience'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The statues of Apollo and the other gods present them in their full youth and strength. &quot;In the balance and relation of their limbs, such figures express their whole character, mental and physical, and reveal their central being, the radiant reality of youth in its heyday&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra, ''The Greek Experience'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic sculpture===
Numerous free-standing statues of male youths from [[Archaic Greece]] exist, and were once thought to be representations of Apollo, though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals.&lt;ref&gt;Delphi, 467, 1524&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, V. I. Leonardos proposed the term ''[[kouros]]'' (&quot;male youth&quot;) to refer to those from [[Keratea]]; this usage was later expanded by Henri Lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Leonardos(1895). ''Archaelogiki Ephimeris'', Col 75, n 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lechat (1904). ''La sculpture Attic avant Phidias'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo may be two figures from the [[Ionians|Ionic]] sanctuary on the island of [[Delos]]. Such statues were found across the Greek-speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of ''Apollo Ptoios'', [[Boeotia]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ducat (1971). ''Les Kouroi des Ptoion''.&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly more rare are the life-sized bronze statues. One of the few originals which survived into the present dayâ€”so rare that its discovery in 1959 was described as &quot;a miracle&quot; by Ernst Homann-Wedekingâ€”is the masterpiece bronze, ''[[Piraeus Apollo]]''. It was found in [[Piraeus]], a [[port city]] close to Athens, and is believed to have come from north-eastern [[Peloponnesus]]. It is the only surviving large-scale Peloponnesian statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Homann-Wedeking|first=Ernst|url=https://archive.org/details/artofarchaicgree00homa|title=The Art of Archaic Greece|date=1968|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|pages=144â€“145|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical sculpture===

[[File:Apollon de Mantoue Louvre MA689.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Apollo of Mantua]], marble Roman copy after a 5th-century-BCE Greek original attributed to [[Polykleitos]], MusÃ©e du Louvre]]
[[File:Runeberg ateneum apollon ja marsyas.jpg|thumb|180px|Marble sculpture of Apollo and [[Marsyas]] by [[Walter Runeberg]], at the arrivals hall of [[Ateneum]] in Helsinki, [[Finland]]]]
The famous [[Apollo of Mantua]] and its variants are early forms of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]], a sophisticated seven-stringed variant of the lyre, in his left arm. While none of the Greek originals have survived, several Roman copies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist, of which an example is the [[Apollo Barberini]].

===Hellenistic Greece-Rome===
Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a cithara (as Apollo Citharoedus) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the [[Apollo Lykeios]] and [[Apollo Sauroctonos]] types). The [[Apollo Belvedere]] is a [[marble]] sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of [[Classical Antiquity]] for Europeans, from the [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century. The marble is a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor [[Leochares]], made between 330 and 320 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/museo-pio-clementino/Cortile-Ottagono/apollo-del-belvedere.html |title=Belevedere Apollo |publisher=Vatican Museums (Pio Clementino Museum) |access-date=19 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The life-size so-called &quot;[[Adonis]]&quot; found in 1780 on the site of a ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' near the [[Via Labicana]] in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from [[El Djem]], Roman ''Thysdrus'', he is identifiable as [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] by his effulgent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], though now even a god's divine [[nudity|nakedness]] is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later [[Roman Empire|Empire]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Mosaics in Tunisia: Apollo and the Muses |date=8 July 2008 |access-date=30 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |archive-date=8 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Bieber 1964, Yalouris 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.

==Modern reception==
Apollo often appears in [[Modernity|modern]] and [[Greek mythology in popular culture|popular culture]] due to his status as the god of music, dance and poetry.

Apollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture. [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] composed a &quot;Hymn of Apollo&quot; (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Apollon musagÃ¨te]]'' (1927â€“1928).

In the philosophical discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] impulses, where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity.
